BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma shows distinct differences between males and 
females in incidence, prognosis, and treatment response, suggesting unique 
molecular mechanisms that remain underexplored. This study aims to identify 
sex-specific molecular signatures and therapeutic targets in lung adenocarcinoma 
using multi-omics approaches to inform personalized treatment strategies.
METHODS: We conducted an integrative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic 
data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets, comparing male and female lung 
adenocarcinoma profiles. Transcription factor activity was assessed using TIGER 
on gene expression data, while kinase activity was evaluated with PTM-SEA on 
proteomic data. These results were combined to build a kinase-transcription 
factor signaling network. Potential sex-specific drugs were identified using the 
PRISM drug screening database.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed significant sex-based differences in 
transcription factor and kinase activity. Notably, NR3C1, AR, and AURKA 
exhibited sex-biased expression and activity. The constructed signaling network 
highlighted druggable pathways linked to cancer-related processes, with distinct 
profiles in males and females. PRISM screening identified glucocorticoid 
receptor agonists and aurora kinase inhibitors as promising sex-specific 
therapeutic candidates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the importance of considering sex 
differences in lung adenocarcinoma molecular profiles. The integration of 
transcriptomic and proteomic data reveals sex-specific pathways and potential 
therapies, paving the way for personalized treatment approaches tailored to male 
and female patients.

Plain Language Summary: Lung cancer, specifically lung adenocarcinoma, affects 
men and women differently in terms of how often it occurs, how it progresses, 
and how well treatments work. These differences likely come from a mix of 
genetics, hormones, and lifestyle factors, but the exact reasons are not fully 
understood. Our study used advanced tools to compare the molecular makeup of 
lung tumors in men and women, looking at both gene activity and protein 
function. We found important differences in how certain proteins and genes work 
together in men versus women, including differences that influence cancer growth 
and immune responses. For example, women showed stronger immune activity linked 
to better survival, while men and women responded differently to certain drugs. 
By identifying these differences, we discovered potential new treatments, such 
as drugs targeting specific proteins, that might work better for men or women. 
This research shows that considering sex differences is key to developing 
better, personalized treatments for lung cancer, which could improve outcomes 
for all patients.

Despite having multiple treatment options, the overall outcomes, including the 
survival rates of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, remain relatively 
low, indicating the need to explore new approaches to achieve improved 
therapeutic responses. To that end, repurposed drugs such as metformin have been 
evaluated against many cancer types, including NSCLC. Metformin, a widely used 
oral hypoglycemic drug for type 2 diabetes, exhibits anticancer properties and 
synergy with several standards of care agents. In this review, we provide a 
comprehensive overview of the role and anticancer mechanisms of metformin-based 
combination approaches for the treatment of NSCLC. We logically discussed the 
experimental evidence from the in vitro and in vivo studies utilizing metformin 
alone, and then its combination with chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapy, 
and immunotherapy. We also present clinical trials that underscore the 
beneficial and adverse outcomes of metformin use in combination with targeted 
therapy and chemotherapeutic agents, and emphasize the limitations and 
challenges for the treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic NSCLC patients. It 
appears that, regardless of the diverse anticancer mechanisms of this biguanide, 
the benefits may be confined to a specific patient subgroup, which opens new 
avenues to be explored for NSCLC treatment.

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and cancer are 2 leading global causes 
of mortality, with shared modifiable risk factors, yet the genetic and molecular 
mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remain poorly understood.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide pleiotropy analysis to identify shared 
genetic mechanisms across CAD and 4 common cancers that share modifiable risk 
factors with CAD (breast, colorectal, lung, prostate).
RESULTS: Using genome-wide pleiotropy and colocalization analysis, we identified 
60 colocalized susceptibility loci shared by CAD and site-specific cancer, of 
which 43 are novel, including loci at TERT, MYO9B, and SREBF1. For 35 loci, the 
lead SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) exhibited opposing effects on CAD and 
cancer risk. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed distinct enrichment patterns 
of same-direction and opposing-direction pleiotropic loci, including 
differential associations with blood pressure-related traits, blood cell traits, 
and waist circumference. By integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data in 
multitrait colocalization, 13 pleiotropic loci influenced CAD and cancer risk 
via differential gene or protein expression of neighboring genes, including 
CALCRL, ANGPTL4, and LAMC1, targets of approved or investigational medications. 
Phenome-wide association analysis in the UK Biobank identified 1955 associations 
(false discovery rate [FDR] P<0.05) of lead SNPs at multitrait colocalized loci 
with serum biomarkers and clinical measures, with apoA, HDL (high-density 
lipoprotein) cholesterol, and creatinine being associated with the largest 
number of lead SNPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight shared and opposing genetic loci between CAD 
and cancer and provide insight into molecular intermediates mediating joint 
disease risk. Importantly, they indicate potential drug repurposing 
opportunities for dual CAD and cancer prevention while highlighting possible 
adverse and divergent effects of existing medications across both conditions.

Statins were initially developed as lipid-lowering agents to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Recently, their anti-tumor effects 
have gained attention in the context of drug repositioning. However, most in 
vitro studies have been conducted under normoxic conditions, and limited 
research has examined their effects under hypoxia. Since hypoxia plays a crucial 
role in the tumor microenvironment by promoting cancer cell proliferation, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance, 
evaluating the anti-tumor effects of statins under hypoxic conditions is 
essential. Additionally, previous in vitro studies have used statin 
concentrations substantially higher than those observed in the serum during 
hyperlipidemia treatment, raising concerns about their clinical applicability as 
anti-tumor agents. Here, we demonstrate that a clinically relevant concentration 
of atorvastatin (0.1 μM) inhibits the migration and invasion of the 
statin-sensitive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line HOP-92 under 
hypoxic conditions, without inducing drug resistance. Furthermore, atorvastatin 
(0.1-1 μM) reduced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in the 
statin-resistant NSCLC cell line NCI-H322M, even though it did not inhibit cell 
proliferation. Since cancer cell migration and invasion are key processes in 
distant metastasis, and HIF-1α is a critical transcription factor that regulates 
metastasis, these findings suggest that statins could be repurposed as 
anti-metastatic agents for NSCLC, particularly under hypoxic conditions.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) are major global health problems. Despite clinical differences, emerging 
evidence suggests common molecular underpinnings, particularly between COPD and 
the 2 primary NSCLC subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell 
carcinoma (LUSC). In this integrative bioinformatics case-control study, we 
analyzed gene expression datasets (GSE76925, GSE18842, and GSE10072) obtained 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, each comprising case-control 
samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in COPD, LUAD, 
and LUSC patients. We performed analyses of protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
networks, investigated regulatory networks involving transcription factors (TFs) 
and microRNAs (miRNAs), and conducted pathway enrichment analysis using Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. 
Drug-gene interactions were assessed to explore therapeutic opportunities. We 
identified 15 shared DEGs between COPD, LUAD, and LUSC, with distinct gene 
expression patterns between COPD-LUAD and COPD-LUSC. Notably, LUAD exhibited 
stronger molecular similarities with COPD than with LUSC. PPI analysis revealed 
COL10A1, POSTN, SPP1, MMP11, and GREM1 as key hub genes in extracellular matrix 
(ECM) remodeling and tumor progression. Functional enrichment highlighted ECM 
organization, apoptosis regulation, and transcriptional control as crucial 
processes in COPD-associated NSCLC. COPD-LUAD was enriched in cancer-related 
pathways, while COPD-LUSCs showed stronger immune and lipid metabolism 
involvement. Regulatory network analysis identified SP1 as a key transcriptional 
regulator, particularly in COPD-LUAD cells. miRNA-DEG interactions highlighted 
""hsa-miR-335-5p,"" ""hsa-miR-192-5p,"" and ""hsa-miR-215-5p"" as the central 
regulators of COPD and NSCLC. Drug-gene interaction analysis identified 
Marimastat, Bosentan, and Minocycline as potential therapeutic agents that 
target key molecular pathways shared across COPD, LUAD and LUSC. Finally, 
survival analysis revealed that SPP1 (in LUAD), POSTN, and GREM1 (in LUSC) were 
significantly associated with better overall survival, suggesting their dual 
utility as both biomarkers and prognostic indicators. Our research highlights 
the unique regulatory distinctions between LUAD and LUSC while offering fresh 
insights into the molecular pathways that COPD and NSCLC share. This study 
represents the initial effort to map TF-miRNA-DEG-drug networks across COPD and 
both the LUAD and LUSC subtypes. These results suggest potential biomarkers for 
early diagnosis and highlight opportunities for drug repurposing to mitigate 
COPD-associated lung cancer risk.

Sarcoidosis patients exhibit an elevated risk of developing lung cancer (LC), 
suggesting shared genetic and molecular mechanisms between these conditions. 
This study aimed to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 
sarcoidosis and LC and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a repurposable 
drug targeting these shared genes. Gene expression datasets (GSE157671 and 
GSE229253) were analyzed to identify overlapping DEGs, with validation performed 
using additional GEO datasets and the GEPIA tool. Functional enrichment and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were conducted using Enrichr and 
STRING, while associated miRNAs and transcription factors were identified via 
miRNet. Twelve DEGs-SALL4, WNT10A, RASAL1, CAMK2B, GADD45B, KLF4, OLR1, CSF3, 
WIF1, RAMP3, AGER, and PRKAG3-were consistently dysregulated in both diseases. 
These genes were significantly associated with epithelial cell enrichment and 
the Wnt signaling pathway. Drug-gene interaction analysis using DGIdb 
prioritized metformin as a candidate drug targeting PRKAG3. Its structural 
integrity was confirmed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld refinement. In 
vitro validation using MTT assays revealed that metformin selectively reduced 
viability in A549 (adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells) and 
HeLa (a widely used epithelial cancer cell line), with minimal cytotoxicity in 
WI38 normal lung fibroblasts. Colony formation assays further demonstrated 
dose-dependent, long-term growth inhibition in cancer cells, corroborated by 
observable morphological alterations. Overall, this study highlights shared 
pathogenic signatures between sarcoidosis and LC and proposes metformin as a 
promising therapeutic candidate. These findings support the rationale for drug 
repurposing and the development of targeted therapies for patients with 
overlapping disease profiles or those at increased risk of LC progression from 
sarcoidosis.

BACKGROUND: Cisplatin and its derivatives remain a cornerstone in the treatment 
of solid malignancies. Resistance is a major factor limiting their clinical 
utility.
OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we set out to interrogate therapeutic 
approaches to target cisplatin-resistant cancer cells. We focused on therapies 
exploiting metabolic pathways that are altered in drug-resistant cells. We 
sought to find an existing therapy that has monotherapy efficacy against 
cisplatin-resistant cancer cells that can also re-sensitize to cisplatin.
METHODS: We used lung and ovarian cancer cell lines with acquired resistance to 
cisplatin together with drug sensitivity assays, conducted both with 
monotherapies and cisplatin combinations.
RESULTS: We show that cancer cell lines with acquired resistance to cisplatin 
have altered levels of enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism, which can 
result in differential sensitivity to targeted agents. We show that expression 
of one of these enzymes-the glutamate-cystine antiporter SLC7A11, up-regulated 
6-fold in a cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cell line-has potential prognostic 
significance in lung cancer but not ovarian cancer. After identifying a common 
dependency of cisplatin-resistant cancer cells upon extracellular glutamine, we 
then evaluate the utility of the long-standing anti-leukemic therapy 
asparaginase (ASNase)-which possesses both asparaginase and glutaminase 
activity-as a potential approach. We show ASNase preferentially inhibits the 
proliferation of cisplatin-resistant cancer cells and can potentially 
re-sensitize these cells to cisplatin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results underpin the prevalence of altered metabolism in 
cisplatin-resistant cells and highlight the potential utility of re-purposing 
ASNase to target these cells, warranting further investigation.

The antimalarial agent Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has significant potential for 
drug repurposing for cancer therapy including non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). However, its underlying anti-tumor mechanisms remain to be elucidated. 
In this study, we demonstrated that DHA suppressed the mouse double minute 2 
(MDM2) in A549 and H1299 cells, whereas MDM2 overexpression effectively restored 
DHA's inhibition on both NSCLC cell lines. We showed that DHA acted via 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and Janus kinase 
(JAK)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling 
pathways to inhibit MDM2 expression. Being an established MDM2 target, p53 was 
significantly upregulated in p53 wild-type A549 cells upon DHA treatment both in 
vitro and in vivo; however, the mediating role of MDM2 in DHA's suppression on 
NSCLC is independent of p53 since DHA-treated si-p53 A549 cells had comparable 
colony formation capacity compared with that of si-Control. The anti-tumor 
effects of DHA bypass p53 was further implicated using H1299, a cell line which 
is MDM2-overexpressed but p53-null. Instead, c-Myc was observed to mediate the 
effects of DHA/MDM2 axis as co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis showed the 
direct protein interaction between MDM2 and c-Myc, both were substantially 
reduced upon DHA treatment. Furthermore, c-Myc overexpression effectively 
restored DHA's suppression on proliferation, and DHA's induction on apoptosis of 
A549 and H1299 cells. Finally, immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis showed that 
in vivo administration of DHA substantially reduced both MDM2 and c-Myc 
expression in xenograft murine models. Taken together, our results demonstrated 
that DHA inhibits NSCLC by targeting MDM2/c-Myc axis independent of p53.

Lung cancer (LC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths 
globally, with both small and non-small cell lung cancer contributing to an 
estimated 1.80 million deaths annually. Drug resistance in LC treatment causes 
around 700,000 deaths globally and poses major economic challenges. While nearly 
100 FDA-approved LC drugs exist, most target single proteins or pathways, making 
resistance more likely. There is an urgent need for multitargeted drugs that 
inhibit multiple pathways to reduce resistance and side effects. In this study, 
we examined 34 proteins from various LC-related pathways and prepared them for 
screening against the DrugBank library. Using high-throughput virtual screening 
(HTVS), standard precision (SP), and extra precision (XP) docking algorithms in 
Glide, we identified Imidurea (DB14075) as a promising multitargeted inhibitor. 
Docking scores ranged from -5.507 to -12.155 kcal/mol, and poses were refined 
through MM/GBSA calculations. Molecular fingerprinting was performed to analyse 
interaction patterns, and DFT and pharmacokinetics were assessed. Bonding angles 
were optimised to evaluate relative binding energy, followed by 100 ns MD 
simulations in water to assess stability and effectiveness. Imidurea showed 
strong multitargeted inhibitory effects across all 34 LC proteins, with docking 
scores between -5.507 and - 12.155 kcal/mol. MD simulations further supported 
its stability in binding to these targets. In MTT assays on A549 cells, Imidurea 
demonstrated dose-dependent anticancer effects, causing significant cell cycle 
arrest and cell death at 100 μg/mL. Imidurea is an affordable compound with 
promising multitargeted anticancer potential, particularly beneficial for 
developing nations and underprivileged groups. While these computational and in 
vitro MTT assays are encouraging, further detailed in vitro and in vivo studies 
are necessary to validate their efficacy and safety before clinical application.

The activation of the PPARG transcription factor is linked to reduced non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) growth. Bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and molecular 
docking/dynamics studies assessing pioglitazone and telmisartan as repurposed 
PPARG agonists for treating NSCLC with a targeted delivery system was done. 
Bioinformatics confirmed that the expression of the PPARG gene can predict 
outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma and is related to immune cells present in the 
tumor. Cheminformatics data showed that pioglitazone and telmisartan have a 
strong attraction to the PPARG receptor, with good efficiency as ligands. Both 
drugs were found to be lipophilic, suggesting compatibility with a targeted 
delivery formulation that may include albumin. Further cheminformatics 
predictions highlighted systemic toxicity values and the need for targeted 
delivery to minimize toxic side effects. Molecular docking and dynamics 
simulations showed that the telmisartan-MyoVc cargo domain complex was strong 
and stable during an 18 ns simulation period. Bioinformatics and cheminformatics 
data support pioglitazone and telmisartan as promising repurposed drugs for 
LUAC, highlighting their lipophilicity and compatibility with exosomal 
components like albumin. Cheminformatics also pointed out potential off-target 
effects and hepatotoxicity, emphasizing the importance of exosomal targeted 
delivery. Molecular docking and MD simulations confirmed the affinity and 
stability of drug-exosomal vehicle complexes. The proposed engineering of 
exosomal cargo for targeted delivery of these drugs to lung cells could enhance 
NSCLC treatment and address drug resistance while minimizing systemic toxicity.

Lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains a 
significant challenge in oncology despite advances in targeted and immune-based 
therapies. NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, with 
five-year survival rates ranging from 4 to 17%, depending on disease stage and 
regional factors. Chemotherapy resistance remains a major hurdle, contributing 
to poor patient prognosis. This study explores the therapeutic potential of 
Sd-021, a novel decursinol derivative, compared to its parent compound, 
decursin, within various NSCLC cell lines. Our results reveal that Sd-021 
demonstrates enhanced anticancer activity, highlighted by a more significant 
reduction in cell viability, increased induction of apoptosis, and more 
pronounced cell cycle arrest. Notably, Sd-021 shows increased inhibition of the 
EGFR/STAT3 signaling pathway in EGFR wild-type cell lines, including A549, H460, 
and H1299 cells. Moreover, in vivo experiments employing a subcutaneous 
xenograft mouse model reveal that Sd-021 reduces tumor volume with minimal 
systemic toxicity, as indicated by histopathological assessments revealing 
reduced tumor proliferation and heightened apoptosis. The minimal toxicity of 
Sd-021 offers reassurance regarding its safety for potential clinical 
applications. In conclusion, these findings highlight the promise of Sd-021 as a 
therapeutic agent against NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Pleural mesothelioma is a cancer of the lung lining associated with 
asbestos exposure. Platinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy has been used for many years 
but provides little benefit and, despite recent immunotherapy advances, 
prognosis remains poor underpinning the need for development of novel 
therapeutics or drug repurposing. Fertilized hens' eggs provide a rapid and 
cost-effective alternative to murine models of pleural mesothelioma which are 
commonly used in preclinical studies, with chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) 
xenografts being a partial replacement for mouse flank xenografts. Here we 
describe methods to generate mesothelioma patient-derived xenografts on the CAM 
(CAM-PDX), and to subsequently assess these PDX nodules by preclinical imaging 
and histology.
METHODS: Fragments of surplus mesothelioma tissue obtained from patient biopsies 
were implanted onto the CAM on embryonic day 7 (E7), fresh or following 
cryopreservation, with the established PDX dissected on E14 and fixed for 
histological/immunohistochemical analysis. The optimal freezing method was 
determined by comparing tissue integrity and cellular content of cryopreserved 
tissue fragments with paired fresh samples via histological/immunohistochemical 
analyses. [ 18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed 
tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was used to assess viability of PDXs in ovo.
RESULTS: Methodologies for processing, cryopreservation, re-animation, and 
engraftment of mesothelioma tissue fragments were established. Cryopreservation 
of biopsy samples and parallel processing of contiguous sections allows for 
assessment of mesothelioma cellularity. CAM-PDXs, generated from fresh or 
slow-frozen tissue, were well vascularized whilst maintaining the architecture 
and cellular composition of the patient tissue. Furthermore, uptake of [ 
18F]-FDG following intravenous injection could be visualized and quantified.
CONCLUSIONS: The CAM is a rapid platform for engrafting patient-derived tissue, 
maintaining elements of the tumor microenvironment and recapitulating 
heterogeneity observed in mesothelioma. Combining the CAM-PDX model and 
FDG-PET/CT provides a quantitative in vivo platform for pre-screening of novel 
treatment strategies and drug combinations, with the potential for development 
of patient tumor avatars for predicting clinical response.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is highly malignant with limited treatment 
options, largely due to the inherent tumoral heterogeneity and acquired 
resistance towards chemotherapy and immunotherapy. RG7388, a known MDM2 
inhibitor, exhibited anticancer activity in TP53-wild-type (TP53WT) NSCLC by 
triggering the p53/PUMA axis-dependent apoptosis. However, our study uncovered 
previously unrecognized p53-independent anticancer effects of RG7388 in 
TP53-mutant (TP53mutant) NSCLC, although the underlying mechanisms remained 
elusive. Here, we demonstrated that RG7388 specifically induced the 
NOXA/caspase-3 axis-dependent apoptosis and gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated 
secondary pyroptosis in TP53mutant NSCLC, as validated through in silico 
analyses and multiple biological assays. Mechanically, we identified reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) as the critical mediator in NOXA upregulation and p38 MAPK 
pathway activation in RG7388 treated TP53mutant NSCLC. This was further 
supported by the use of ROS scavengers, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and 
Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), which attenuated these effects. Pharmacologic inhibition 
of p38 MAPK signaling by SB203580 rescued RG7388-induced ROS-dependent NOXA 
accumulation and subsequent apoptosis and pyroptosis, highlighting the central 
role of the ROS/phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38)/NOXA/caspase-3 axis in 
RG7388-induced TP53mutant NSCLC cell death. Our findings revealed a novel 
mechanism for selectively targeting mutant p53-derived cancer through 
ROS/p-p38-mediated NOXA accumulation, offering potential therapeutic 
implications given the current lack of direct mutant p53 targeting strategies in 
cancer. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of an NSCLC tissue 
microarray confirmed a strong positive correlation between p-p38 and NOXA 
expression. Clinical data analysis further suggested that the p-p38/NOXA axis 
might be a potential prognostic biomarker for overall survival (OS) in NSCLC 
patients.

OBJECTIVES: Fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin (LVX), are extended-spectrum 
drugs used for the treatment of bacterial infections. Several fluoroquinolone 
derivatives have shown promising antibacterial and anticancer activities. Our 
group has earlier synthesized and investigated thionated LVX analogs, compounds 
2 and 3, on A549 (non-small cell lung cancer) cell line and showed promising 
anticancer activity. The mechanism of cytotoxicity may be, in part, via aldehyde 
dehydrogenase enzyme inhibition and antioxidation. In this study, compounds 2 
and 3 were evaluated on prostate (PC-3), breast (MCF7), colorectal (Caco-2), and 
small cell lung cancer (H69 and H69AR) cell lines.
METHODS: The anticancer activity was measured using resazurin colorimetric 
method. Combination treatments with doxorubicin (DOX) were also employed and 
combination index (CI) value were calculated.
RESULTS: Compound 3 possessed higher anticancer activity compared to compound 2 
on the tested cancer cell lines. Compound 3 had the highest activity on PC-3 
cells with IC50 value of 3.58 µM. DOX was also tested for comparison and had 
IC50 value of less than 0.5 µM in all tested cell lines except for H69AR 
(DOX-resistant form of H69), which was 4.62 µM. Combination treatment with DOX 
resulted in significant reduction of cell viability in PC-3, H69, and H69AR 
cells, with those on H69 and H69AR cells resulted in additive (CI = 1.0) and 
synergistic effects (CI = 0.6), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compound 3, a thionated LVX derivative, showed a promising 
anticancer activity, prompting its potential repurposing for cancer treatment as 
well as combination treatment with DOX on DOX-resistant cancer cells.

Lung cancer is among the most common malignancies globally, is frequently 
associated with a poor prognosis, and is the second leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality in both genders. Resistance to treatment, 
heterogeneity, and invasiveness make lung cancer one of the most challenging 
tumors to combat. Drug repurposing is considered an advantageous strategy for 
expediting and economizing drug discovery, as it involves rebranding an existing 
drug for a new therapeutic use. Since depression is a prevalent psychiatric 
illness among individuals diagnosed with lung cancer, various selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) used for the treatment of depression were 
examined for their possible use in lung cancer treatment as repurposed drugs. 
Herein, we evaluated the efficacy of SSRIs, both alone and in combination with 
various anticancer agents, in the treatment of lung cancer along with their 
mechanisms of action. The innovative approach of repurposing SSRIs offers hope 
by simplifying the drug discovery process and potentially revealing new 
therapeutic options for lung cancer. Exploring SSRIs' effects on lung cancer 
treatment may unlock unexpected avenues for combating this aggressive disease.

Proteins are fundamental biomolecules composed of one or more chains of amino 
acids. They are essential for all living organisms, contributing to various 
biological functions and regulatory processes. Alterations in protein structures 
and functions are closely linked to diseases, emphasizing the need for in-depth 
study. A thorough understanding of these associations is crucial for developing 
targeted and more effective therapeutic strategies.Computational analyses of 
biomedical data facilitate the identification of specific patterns in proteins 
associated with diseases, providing novel insights into their biological roles. 
This study introduces a computational approach designed to detect relevant 
sequence patterns within proteins. These patterns, characterized by specific 
amino acid arrangements, can be critical for protein functionality. The proposed 
methodology was applied to proteins targeted by drugs used in lung cancer 
treatment, a disease that remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide. Given that non-small cell lung cancer represents 85-90% of all lung 
cancer cases, it was selected as the primary focus of this study.Significant 
sequence patterns were identified, establishing connections between drug-target 
proteins and proteins associated with lung cancer. Based on these findings, a 
novel computational framework was developed to extend this pattern-based 
analysis to proteins linked to other diseases. By employing this approach, 
relationships between lung cancer drug-target proteins and proteins associated 
with four additional cancer types were uncovered. These associations, 
characterized by shared amino acid sequence features, suggest potential 
opportunities for drug repurposing. Furthermore, validation through an extensive 
literature review confirmed biological links between lung cancer drug-target 
proteins and proteins related to other malignancies, reinforcing the potential 
of this methodology for identifying new therapeutic applications.

BACKGROUND/AIM: SH003, a novel herbal mixture consisting of Astragalus 
membranaceus, Angelica gigas, and Trichosanthes kirilowii Maximowicz, has shown 
promising anti-cancer effects in various cancers, including non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), which comprises approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. 
Characterized by high mortality rates due to late-stage diagnosis and frequent 
development of resistance to traditional therapies, NSCLC is a significant 
clinical challenge. This study investigated the anti-cancer effects of SH003 on 
NSCLC cells, focusing on its role in modulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 
signaling pathways.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: NSCLC cell lines (A549, H460, HCC827) were treated with 
SH003 to evaluate cell viability (MTT assay), colony formation, apoptosis 
(Annexin V/7-AAD staining, western blot), and cell cycle distribution (PI 
staining). Phosphorylation of RTKs and related signaling molecules was analyzed 
using a phospho-RTK array and western blot. In vivo anti-tumor effects were 
assessed using an A549 xenograft mouse model treated orally with SH003.
RESULTS: NSCLC cell lines A549, H460, and HCC827 treated with SH003 showed 
significant, dose-dependent cell viability and colony formation reductions. 
SH003 induced apoptosis, evidenced by increased cleaved PARP and caspase-8 
levels, and caused G1/S cell cycle arrest. Additionally, SH003 treatment 
decreased phosphorylation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), 
including ErbB4, FGFR1, FGFR3, and PDGFRβ, as confirmed by an RTK array. In an 
A549 xenograft mouse model, SH003 inhibited tumor growth without affecting body 
weight, indicating low systemic toxicity.
CONCLUSION: SH003 is a promising multi-target therapeutic agent for NSCLC, 
offering a novel strategy to improve patient outcomes.

This study investigated a novel immunization therapy for pre-clinical aggressive 
metastatic breast cancer using immunogenic cell lysates derived from 4T1-luc 
cells treated with cisplatin and methotrexate, addressing the critical need for 
improved treatments given the poor prognosis associated with breast cancer 
metastasis and its significant mortality rate. Methotrexate, a conventional 
cytotoxic agent, demonstrated a previously unrecognized capacity to induce 
immunogenic cell lysates, presenting a potential drug repositioning opportunity. 
In a murine model of stage IV metastatic breast cancer, immunization with these 
lysates significantly reduced primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, as 
assessed by bioluminescence imaging. Immunization also modulated immune cell 
populations, reducing splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, and partially reversing the 
immunosuppressive phenotype associated with 4T1-luc tumor growth, as evidenced 
by cytokine profiling (IL-6 and IFN-γ) and flow cytometry analysis of CD4 + and 
CD8 + T cell subpopulations. Specifically, methotrexate-treated lysates induced 
a significant shift in CD4 + T cells towards an effector phenotype. These 
findings highlight the potential of this immunotherapy approach to improve 
breast cancer treatment outcomes and warrant further investigation.

In this study, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins 
interacting with USP24. Out of 250 such proteins, functional enrichment analysis 
using MetaCore™ indicated that 33 of them were involved in lung cancer 
progression. We then investigated gene expression and survival rates of these 33 
proteins in lung cancer patients and cell lines through TCGA databases, 
Kaplan-Meier Plotter databases, and RNA-seq profile from A549/A549-T24 cells. By 
employing the patients' survival rate and gene expression profile of these 33 
USP24-interacting proteins as gene signatures, we identified 10 potential drugs 
for inhibiting lung cancer progression or drug resistance via drug repurposing 
strategy using the Connectivity Map (CMap) database. Of these 10 drugs, six 
showed similar indicators in Clinical Trials, while the other four candidates 
(15-delta prostaglandin J2, Astemizole, Trifluoperazine, and 
1,4-chrysenequinone) were chosen to evaluate their effect on re-sensitizing 
cytotoxicity of Taxol and Gefitinib in drug-resistant cancer cells. Experiments 
demonstrated that treatment with USP24-i-101 and Astemizole alone significantly 
inhibited drug resistance and re-sensitized the cytotoxicity of Taxol and 
Gefitinib in drug-resistant lung cancer cells. Notably, combination therapy with 
USP24-i-101and Astemizole re-sensitized the cytotoxicity of Taxol and Gefitinib 
in drug-resistant lung cancer, which could benefit in inhibiting drug resistance 
during cancer therapy.

Drug repurposing is the process of identifying new clinical indications for an 
existing drug. Some of the recent studies utilized drug response prediction 
models to identify drugs that can be repurposed. By representing cell-line 
features as a pathway-pathway interaction network, we can better understand the 
connections between cellular processes and drug response mechanisms. Existing 
deep learning models for drug response prediction do not integrate known 
biological pathway-pathway interactions into the model. This paper presents a 
drug response prediction model that applies a graph convolution operation on a 
pathway-pathway interaction network to represent features of cancer cell-lines 
effectively. The model is used to identify potential drug repurposing candidates 
for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Experiment results show that the 
inclusion of graph convolutional model applied on a pathway-pathway interaction 
network makes the proposed model more effective in predicting drug response than 
the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the model has shown better 
performance in terms of Root Mean Squared Error, Coefficient of Determination, 
and Pearson's Correlation Coefficient when applied to the GDSC1000 dataset. 
Also, most of the drugs that the model predicted as top candidates for NSCLC 
treatment are either undergoing clinical studies or have some evidence in the 
PubMed literature database.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most malignant tumors and the 
leading cause of death from cancer worldwide and is increasing at a massive rate 
every year. Most NSCLC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, which is 
associated with a poor prognosis and a very low 5-year survival rate. Therefore, 
the purpose of this study is to investigate molecular markers for early 
diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of NSCLC through the integration of 
bioinformatics and statistical methods. A total of 93 overlapping differentially 
expressed genes (oDEGs) were identified between NSCLC and normal samples through 
Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA) and Significance Analysis of Microarrays 
(SAM) methods. Six top-degree oDEGs (CCNA2, CDC6, AURKA, CCNB1, MKI67, and PRC1) 
were identified as key genes (KGs) through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network. The predictive accuracy analysis of the identified KGs revealed an 
accuracy of 96.92 %, with a sensitivity of 91.73 % and a specificity of 98.15 %. 
KGs associated with 3 molecular functions (MFs), 5 cellular components (CCs), 3 
biological processes (BPs), and 4 pathways were identified through FunRich 
software. Analysis of expression levels using the UALCAN database revealed that 
KGs are significantly associated with potential early diagnostic biomarkers. 
Survival analysis using the GEPIA database demonstrated that the KGs possessed 
strong prognostic power for NSCLC. Finally, seven repurposed candidate drugs 
ENTRECTINIB, SORAFENIB, CHEMBL1765740, TOZASERTIB, NERVIANO, AZD-1152-HQPA, and 
SELICICLIB were proposed through molecular docking analysis. In conclusion, the 
findings of this study have the potential to significantly impact the early 
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of NSCLC.

Interaction Prediction.

Predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a crucial step in the development 
of new drugs and drug repurposing. In this paper, we propose a novel drug-target 
prediction model called MCF-DTI. The model utilizes the SMILES representation of 
drugs and the sequence features of targets, employing a multi-scale 
convolutional neural network (MSCNN) with parallel shared-weight modules to 
extract features from the drug side. For the target side, it combines MSCNN with 
Transformer modules to capture both local and global features effectively. The 
extracted features are then weighted and fused, enabling comprehensive feature 
representation to enhance the predictive power of the model. Experimental 
results on the Davis dataset demonstrate that MCF-DTI achieves an AUC of 0.9746 
and an AUPR of 0.9542, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Our case 
study demonstrates that our model effectively validated several known 
drug-target relationships in lung cancer and predicted the therapeutic potential 
of certain preclinical compounds in treating lung cancer. These findings 
contribute valuable insights for subsequent drug repurposing efforts and novel 
drug development.

Drug repurposing of well-established drugs to be targeted against lung cancer 
has been a promising strategy. Bosentan is an endothelin 1 (ET-1) blocker widely 
used in pulmonary hypertension. The current experiment intends to inspect the 
anticancer and antiangiogenic mechanism of bosentan targeting epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) /extra-cellular Signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) 
/c-Jun/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) carcinogenic pathway. BALB/c 
mice were randomized into four groups, the first received the vehicle, the 
second received 100 mg/kg oral bosentan alone, the third has non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) induced by two doses of 1.5 g/kg urethane i.p. and finally the 
fourth has NSCLC received bosentan. To determine the anti-proliferative impact 
of bosentan, cytokeratin 19 fragments (CYFRA 21-1) level was assessed, and Ki-67 
positive cells were counted by immunohistochemical (IHC). Molecular expression 
of EGFR via IHC, relative expression of p-ERK1/2 and p-c-Jun via western 
blotting and caspase 3, Bcl-2 Associated X-protein (BAX)/B-cell lymphoma 2 
(Bcl-2) ratio and VEGF via ELISA were quantified. Bosentan showed pronounced 
improvement in lung index and histopathological examinations. Bosentan exerted a 
noticeable arrest of lung cancer growth indicated by the attenuation of CYFRA 
21-1 and Ki-67 positive cell counts besides the boost of BAX/Bcl-2 ratio and 
caspase 3. Bosentan induced a remarkable decline of EGFR, T-ERK1/2/p-ERK1/2, 
T-c-Jun/p-c-Jun, and VEGF. Bosentan induced cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic impact 
through regulation of EGFR/ERK/c-Jun/VEGF axis suggesting its potential 
therapeutic impact against lung cancer.

Protein phosphorylation plays a crucial role in regulating diverse biological 
processes. Perturbations in protein phosphorylation are closely associated with 
downstream pathway dysfunctions, whereas alterations in protein expression could 
serve as sensitive indicators of pathological status. However, there are 
currently few methods that can accurately identify the regulatory links between 
protein phosphorylation and expression, given issues like reverse causation and 
confounders. Here, we present Phoslink, a causal inference model to infer causal 
effects between protein phosphorylation and expression, integrating prior 
evidence and multiomics data. We demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of 
our method under various simulation scenarios. Phoslink exhibited more robust 
estimates and lower false discovery rate than commonly used Pearson and Spearman 
correlations, with better performance than canonical instrumental variable 
selection methods for Mendelian randomization. Applying this approach, we 
identified 345 causal links involving 109 phosphosites and 310 proteins in 79 
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples. Based on these links, we constructed a 
causal regulatory network and identified 26 key regulatory phosphosites as 
regulators strongly associated with LUAD. Notably, 16 of these regulators were 
exclusively identified through phosphosite-protein causal regulatory 
relationships, highlighting the significance of causal inference. We explored 
potentially druggable phosphoproteins and provided critical clues for drug 
repurposing in LUAD. We also identified significant mediation between protein 
phosphorylation and LUAD through protein expression. In summary, our study 
introduces a new approach for causal inference in phosphoproteomics studies. 
Phoslink demonstrates its utility in potential drug target identification, 
thereby accelerating the clinical translation of cancer proteomics and 
phosphoproteomic data.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) shows limited therapeutic response to 
vinorelbine and carboplatin. Combining these drugs with an antifibrotic drug may 
enhance their antitumor effect. Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic drug whose 
antitumor activity has been described in different types of cancer. This work 
aimed to perform preclinical studies on the combination of pirfenidone with 
vinorelbine, or with vinorelbine plus carboplatin, in NSCLC. Our data revealed 
that pirfenidone sensitized three NSCLC cell lines to vinorelbine by reducing 
cell growth, viability and proliferation, inducing alterations in the cell cycle 
profile, and increasing cell death (%). Importantly, pirfenidone increased the 
sensitivity of the three NSCLC cell lines to the combined treatment of 
vinorelbine plus carboplatin. This combined drug treatment (triplet) did not 
induce cytotoxicity against non-tumorigenic cells. Notably, the triplet drug 
combination significantly reduced the growth and proliferation of A-549 
xenografts in nude mice, as also reduced vimentin and collagen expression. Most 
interestingly, the triplet treatment exhibited a safer toxicological profile 
than the doublet (vinorelbine plus carboplatin) currently applied in the 
clinical practice. Altogether, these preclinical data support the possibility of 
repurposing pirfenidone in combination with vinorelbine or with vinorelbine plus 
carboplatin for NSCLC perioperative treatment, improving therapeutic efficacy 
while reducing toxicity.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Chemoresistance to paclitaxel (PTX) significantly ameliorates 
therapeutic efficacy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
especially in advanced stages, deteriorating the progression free and overall 
survival rates. One of the critical mechanisms contributing to drug resistance 
is the excretion of PTX from target cells via efflux pumps. Ivermectin was 
developed as a bactericidal agent against parasites; however, it has recently 
been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human cancer cells. Hence, we aimed 
to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ivermectin in combination with PTX and 
investigate the molecular mechanisms by which ivermectin overcomes PTX 
resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the antitumor effects of ivermectin in A549 
cells treated with or without PTX. We also established PTX-resistant cells using 
this cell line and explored the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we 
evaluated whether ivermectin attenuates PTX-resistance with the retrieval of 
drug sensitivity.
RESULTS: Combined treatment of A549 cells with PTX and ivermectin inhibited cell 
growth. These cells acquired chemoresistance upon long-term exposure to 
gradually increasing PTX concentrations, which was accompanied by ABCB1 mRNA 
up-regulation, and subsequent overproduction of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
Consistent with this, P-gp over-expression resulted in a PTX-resistant 
phenotype. Notably, the simultaneous ivermectin treatment during the gradual 
exposure completely abolished P-gp expression, leading to an increased 
intracellular PTX concentration and sustained PTX sensitivity. Ivermectin was 
found to regulate P-gp expression via the EGFR/ERK/Akt/NF-[Formula: see text]B 
pathway.
CONCLUSION: Combined treatment of PTX-resistant A549 cells with ivermectin and 
PTX may circumvent PTX resistance caused by P-gp induction, highlighting a novel 
therapeutic avenue for drug repurposing.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-3 (PDK3) plays an important role in the 
regulation of a variety of cancers, including lung, by inhibiting the pyruvate 
dehydrogenase complex (PDC), shifting energy production towards glycolysis 
necessary for cancer metabolism. In this study, we aimed to identify potential 
PDK3 inhibitors using a computer-based drug design approach. Virtual screening 
of the FDA-approved library of 3839 compounds was carried out, from which 
Bagrosin and Dehydrocholic acid appeared best due to their strong binding 
affinity, specific interactions, and potential biological characteristics, and 
thus were selected for further investigations. Both compounds show strong 
interactions with functionally important residues of the PDK3 with a binding 
affinity of - 10.6 and - 10.5 kcal/mol for Bagrosin and Dehydrocholic acid, 
respectively. MD simulation studies for 100 ns suggest the formation of stable 
complexes, which is evident from RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA parameters. The PCA 
and FEL analysis suggested admirable global energy minima for the bagrosin-PDK3 
and dehydrocholic acid-PDK3 complexes. Finally, we identified FDA-approved 
drugs, Bagrosin and Dehydrocholic acid, that offer valuable resources and 
potential therapeutic molecules for targeting lung cancer. Further clinical 
investigations are required to validate the clinical utility of selected 
molecules.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK; also known as ALK tyrosine kinase receptor) 
inhibitors (ALKi) are effective in treating lung cancer patients with 
chromosomal rearrangement of ALK. However, continuous treatment with ALKis 
invariably leads to acquired resistance in cancer cells. In this study, we 
propose an efficient strategy to suppress ALKi resistance through a 
meta-analysis of transcriptome data from various cell models of acquired 
resistance to ALKis. We systematically identified gene signatures that 
consistently showed altered expression during the development of resistance and 
conducted computational drug screening using these signatures. We identified 
emetine as a promising candidate compound to inhibit the growth of 
ALKi-resistant cells. We demonstrated that emetine exhibited effectiveness in 
inhibiting the growth of ALKi-resistant cells, and further interpreted its 
impact on the resistant signatures through drug-induced RNA-sequencing data. Our 
transcriptome-guided systematic approach paves the way for efficient drug 
discovery to overcome acquired resistance to cancer therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To enhance the anticancer activity of the repurposed drug mebendazole 
(MBZ) against A549 cell lines by developing nanostructured lipid carriers 
(NLCs).
SIGNIFICANCE: MBZ, an anthelmintic drug, exhibits anticancer properties 
primarily through the inhibition of Ran GTPase and mitotic spindle assembly. 
Enhancing its delivery and efficacy via NLC could provide a novel and effective 
approach for lung cancer treatment.
METHODS: NLCs were prepared by mixing different ratios of solid lipid (stearic 
acid) and liquid lipid (oleic acid) with surfactants and emulsifiers. The NLCs 
were fully characterized to ensure stability, particle size, zeta potential, and 
encapsulation efficiency (EE%). The stability of the NLCs was monitored over a 
3-week period. The anticancer activity of MBZ-NLCs was evaluated using IC50 
assays and in vitro scratch assays.
RESULTS: The NLCs exhibited an average particle size of 300 ± 10 nm and a zeta 
potential of -27 ± 0.5 mV, indicating good stability. EE% significantly improved 
from 40% in conventional liposome formulations to 90.7% in NLCs. The anticancer 
activity of MBZ-NLCs was markedly enhanced, with an IC50 of 62 nM compared to 
581 nM for free MBZ, representing a 10-fold increase in potency. Additionally, 
in vitro scratch assays revealed that MBZ-NLCs effectively prevented cell-cell 
contact, further supporting their potential for improved therapeutic efficacy.
CONCLUSION: MBZ-NLCs exhibit significantly improved stability, EE%, and 
anticancer activity compared to free MBZ. These promising results suggest that 
MBZ-NLCs could be a potent therapeutic approach for lung cancer treatment, 
warranting further in vivo studies and exploration of different administration 
routes.

This study aims to repurpose sericin in combating non-small lung cancer cells 
(A549 and H460) by combining it with dactolisib or vitamin D to reduce the dose 
of dactolisib and boost the anticancer effectiveness of dactolisib and vitamin 
D. Therefore, the binding affinities of individual and combined drugs were 
examined using in silico and protein-protein interaction studies, targeting 
NF-κB, Cyclin D1, p-AKT, and VEGF1 proteins. The findings manifested remarkable 
affinities for combinatorial drugs compared to individual compounds. To 
substantiate these findings, the combined IC50 for each combination 
(sericin + dactolisib and sericin + vitamin D) were determined, reporting 31.9 
and 41.8 µg/ml, respectively, against A549 cells and 47.9 and 55.3 µg/ml, 
respectively, against H460 cells. Furthermore, combination indices were assessed 
to lower the doses of each drug. Interestingly, in vitro results exhibited 
marked diminutions in NF-κB, Cyclin D1, p-AKT, and VEGF1 after treatment with 
sericin + dactolisib and sericin + vitamin D compared to control lung cancer 
cells and those treated with a single drug. Moreover, A549 and H460 cells 
treated with both combinations demonstrated augmented caspase-3 levels, implying 
substantial apoptotic activity. Altogether, these results accentuated the 
prospective implementation of sericin in combination with dactolisib and vitamin 
D at low doses to preclude lung cancer cell proliferation.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are drugs that inhibit immune checkpoint 
(ICP) molecules to restore the antitumor activity of immune cells and eliminate 
tumor cells. Due to the limitations and certain side effects of current ICIs, 
such as programmed death protein-1, programmed cell death-ligand 1, and 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies, there is an 
urgent need to find new drugs with ICP inhibitory effects. In this study, a 
network-based computational framework called multi-network algorithm-driven drug 
repositioning targeting ICP (Mnet-DRI) is developed to accurately repurpose 
novel ICIs from ≈3000 Food and Drug Administration-approved or investigational 
drugs. By applying Mnet-DRI to PD-L1, maprotiline (MAP), an antidepressant drug 
is repurposed, as a potential PD-L1 modifier for colorectal and lung cancers. 
Experimental validation revealed that MAP reduced PD-L1 expression by targeting 
E3 ubiquitin ligase speckle-type zinc finger structural protein (SPOP), and the 
combination of MAP and anti-CTLA4 in vivo significantly enhanced the antitumor 
effect, providing a new alternative for the clinical treatment of colorectal and 
lung cancer.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to repurpose pimozide (PMZ) by incorporating it into 
nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) using a modified melting emulsion 
ultrasonication method.
METHODS: We employed stearic and oleic acids in a 1:1 ratio as lipids, with 
Tween 80 and PEG 4000 as surfactants. The formulation was analyzed for particle 
size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency. Transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm the spherical shape of the particles. The 
release profile of PMZ-NLC was evaluated under different pH conditions, and 
anticancer activity was tested on A549 cell lines.
RESULTS: The PMZ-NLC exhibited an average particle size of 136 ± 2.9 nm, a zeta 
potential of -25.1 ± 0.9 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency of 86% ± 11. TEM 
confirmed the spherical shape of the NLCs. PMZ release from PMZ-NLC was 
pH-sensitive, enhancing tumor targeting. IC50 values were 16.5 μM for free PMZ 
and 12.9 μM for PMZ-NLC after 72 h.
DISCUSSION: PMZ-NLC demonstrated improved anticancer activity compared to free 
PMZ, suggesting that encapsulation enhances the drug's effectiveness. The 
pH-sensitive release profile supports its potential for targeted therapy in lung 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: PMZ-NLC showed potential as a safe and effective strategy for lung 
cancer treatment. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate its in vivo 
efficacy, long-term safety, and clinical application.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic re-wiring with preferential fatty acid oxidation has been 
observed in lung cancer cells. Whether the use of trimetazidine, an anti-anginal 
agent that inhibits fatty acid oxidation, alters clinical outcomes in ischemic 
heart disease (IHD) patients with lung cancers is unknown.
METHODS: We carried out this territory-wide, retrospective cohort study of 
279,894 IHD patients prescribed with trimetazidine or long-acting oral nitrates 
in Hong Kong (population coverage of 7.5 millions, January 1999 - December 
2020). A total of 6561 patients with pre-existing or de novo lung cancers were 
identified. Clinical outcomes of all-cause mortality were longitudinally 
compared between lung cancer patients who received trimetazidine (n = 547) 
versus non-users (control, n = 6014).
RESULTS: Over 902.9 ± 1410.6 days, lower incidence of deaths occurred in the 
trimetazidine group (79.0 %, n = 432/547) compared to controls (90.5 %, 
n = 5442/6014, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that trimetazidine use 
was associated with significantly higher survival from all-cause mortality in 
IHD patients (trimetazidine: mean survival = 1840.6 [95 %CI 1596.0-2085.3], 
versus control: 1056.7 [95 %CI 1011.3-1102.0] days, Log Rank = 69.4, P < 0.001). 
Cox regression showed that trimetazidine use was significantly associated with 
reduced risk of all-cause mortality in crude (HR = 0.60 [95 %CI: 0.53 to 0.68], 
P < 0.001) and multivariable models (HR = 0.65 [95 % CI: 0.57 to 0.74], 
P < 0.001). Pre-specified analyses amongst patients with pre-existing lung 
cancers yielded similar findings (HR = 0.49 [95 %CI: 0.35 to 0.67], P < 0.001). 
Survival benefits related to trimetazidine use was predominantly restricted to 
non-cardiovascular mortality (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Trimetazidine use is associated with higher overall survival in IHD 
patients with lung cancers, particularly from non-cardiovascular death. These 
findings need to be confirmed by randomized controlled trials.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequently 
diagnosed malignancy and the first cause of cancer-related death. Thus, finding 
alternative therapeutic options is crucial. Drug repurposing offers therapeutic 
options in a simplified and affordable manner, especially to cancer patients in 
developing countries. Several drugs including antihistamines and beta-adrenergic 
receptor blockers (beta-blockers) display antiproliferative properties on cancer 
cells. Interestingly, NSCLC patients who had used either antihistamines or 
beta-blockers showed improved response to chemotherapy or reduced mortality in 
comparison to non-users of any of these drugs. However, combination therapy is 
gaining substantial interest in many cancers including non-EGFR mutated NSCLC. 
Here, we investigated the antineoplastic effect of the combination of the 
antihistamine loratadine, the beta-blocker nebivolol, and the tyrosine-kinase 
inhibitor gefitinib on NSCLC cell lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A-549 and NCI-H1975 cell lines were used. The effect of 
nebivolol, gefitinib, and loratadine on the metabolic activity was studied using 
the MTT assay. The inhibitory concentrations (IC20 and IC50) were calculated and 
used in the drug-combination experiments. Apoptosis was investigated using flow 
cytometry; and cell survival using the colony formation assay.
RESULTS: The combination nebivolol-loratadine-gefitinib produced a significant 
synergistic effect on inhibiting the metabolic activity and colony formation, as 
well as on promoting apoptosis in both cell lines. Noteworthy, the effect on the 
cell line carrying the EGFR mutation (NCI-H1975) was very similar to the cell 
line that does not exhibit such mutation (A-549 cells).
CONCLUSION: The nebivolol-gefitinib-loratadine combination may be a promising 
alternative for lung cancer treatment.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), representing 85% of lung cancer cases, is 
characterized by its heterogeneity and progression through distinct stages. This 
study applied Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to explore 
the molecular mechanisms of NSCLC and identify potential therapeutic targets. 
Gene expression data from the GEO database were analyzed across four NSCLC 
stages (NSCLC1, NSCLC2, NSCLC3, and NSCLC4), with the NSCLC2 dataset selected as 
the reference for module preservation analysis. WGCNA identified eight highly 
preserved modules-Cyan, Yellow, Red, Dark Turquoise, Turquoise, White, Purple, 
and Royal Blue-across datasets, which were enriched in key pathways such as 
""Cell cycle"" and ""Pathways in cancer"", involving processes like cell division 
and inflammatory responses. Hub genes, including PLK1, CDK1, and EGFR, emerged 
as critical regulators of tumor proliferation and immune responses. Estrogen 
receptor ESR1 was also highlighted, correlating with improved survival outcomes, 
suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Signature-based drug 
repurposing analysis identified promising therapeutic candidates, including 
GW-5074, which inhibits RAF and disrupts the EGFR-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling 
cascade, and olomoucine, a CDK1 inhibitor. Additional candidates like 
pinocembrin, which reduces NSCLC cell invasion by modulating 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and citalopram, an SSRI with 
anti-carcinogenic properties, were also identified. These findings provide 
valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of NSCLC and suggest new 
directions for therapeutic strategies through drug repurposing.

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women worldwide, with 
drug resistance driven by transcription factors and mutations posing significant 
challenges. To address this, we present ResisenseNet, a predictive model for 
drug sensitivity and resistance. ResisenseNet integrates transcription factor 
expression, genomic markers, drugs, and molecular descriptors, employing a 
hybrid architecture of 1D-CNN + LSTM and DNN to effectively learn long-range and 
temporal patterns from amino acid sequences and transcription factor data. The 
model demonstrated exceptional predictive accuracy, achieving a validation 
accuracy of 0.9794 and a loss value of 0.042. Comprehensive validation included 
comparisons with state-of-the-art models and ablation studies, confirming the 
robustness of the developed architecture. ResisenseNet has been applied to 
repurpose existing anticancer drugs across 14 different cancers, with a focus on 
breast cancer. Among the malignancies studied, drugs targeting Low-grade Glioma 
(LGG) and Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) showed increased sensitivity to breast 
cancer as per ResisenseNet's assessment. Further evaluation of the predicted 
sensitive drugs revealed that 14 had no prior history of anticancer activity 
against breast cancer. These drugs target key signaling pathways involved in 
breast cancer, presenting novel therapeutic opportunities. ResisenseNet 
addresses drug resistance by filtering ineffective compounds and enhancing 
chemotherapy for breast cancer. In vitro studies on sensitive drugs provide 
valuable insights into breast cancer prognosis, contributing to improved 
treatment strategies.

Drug repositioning is gaining attention as a method for developing new drugs due 
to its low cost, short cycle time, and high success rate. One important approach 
is to explore new uses for already marketed drugs. In this study, we utilized 
the strategy of drug repositioning, focusing on the Dan-Lou tablet. We predicted 
the efficacy of Dan-Lou tablet against non-small cell lung cancer based on gene 
expression similarity and verified it by in vitro experiments. Next, we 
performed further analysis and validation using network pharmacology, molecular 
docking and molecular dynamics. Based on the results, it was concluded that 
Dan-Lou tablet mainly acted through nine compounds, Quercetin, Luteolin, 
Scoparone, Isorhamnetin, Eugenol, Genistein, Coumestrol, Hederagenin, Succinic 
Acid, and mainly targeted CCL2, FEN1, TPI1, RMI2 by six pathways. This discovery 
not only provides a new idea for the development of Dan-Lou tablet but also 
provides useful predictive information for clinical treatment. The method we 
adopted has great development prospects as a way to predict the efficacy of new 
drugs and their main mechanisms of action, and it has a positive impact on the 
research and development of new drugs using drug repositioning and the 
modernization of traditional Chinese medicine.

Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) prediction is vital for drug repositioning. 
The accuracy and generalizability of DTA models remain a major challenge. Here, 
we develop a model composed of BERT-Trans Block, Multi-Trans Block, and DTI 
Learning modules, referred to as Molecular Representation Encoder-based DTA 
prediction (MREDTA). MREDTA has three advantages: (1) extraction of both local 
and global molecular features simultaneously through skip connections; (2) 
improved sensitivity to molecular structures through the Multi-Trans Block; (3) 
enhanced generalizability through the introduction of BERT. Compared with 12 
advanced models, benchmark testing of KIBA and Davis datasets demonstrated 
optimal performance of MREDTA. In case study, we applied MREDTA to 2034 
FDA-approved drugs for treating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), all of which 
act on mutant EGFRT790M protein. The corresponding molecular docking results 
demonstrated the robustness of MREDTA.

Recent breakthrough therapies have improved survival rates in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), but a paradigm for prospective confirmation is still 
lacking. Patientdatasets were mainly downloaded from TCGA, CPTAC and GEO. We 
conducted downstream analysis by collecting metagenes and generated 42-gene 
subtype classifiers to elucidate biological pathways. Subsequently, scRNA, eRNA, 
methylation, mutation, and copy number variation were depicted from a phenotype 
perspective. Enhancing the clinical translatability of molecular subtypes, 
preclinical models including CMAP, CCLE, and GDSC were utilized for drug 
repositioning. Importantly, we verified the presence of previously described 
three phenotypes including bronchioid, neuroendocrine, and squamoid. Poor 
prognosis was seen in squamoid and neuroendocrine clusters for treatment-naive 
and immunotherapy populations. The neuroendocrine cluster was dominated by STK11 
mutations and 14q13.3 amplifications, whose related methylated loci are 
predictive of immunotherapy. And the greatest therapeutic potential lies in the 
bronchioid cluster. We further estimated the relative cell abundance of the 
tumor microenvironment (TME), specific cell types could be reflected among three 
clusters. Meanwhile, the higher portion of immune cell infiltration belonged to 
bronchioid and squamoid, not the neuroendocrine cluster. In drug repositioning, 
MEK inhibitors resisted bronchioid but were squamoid-sensitive. To conceptually 
validate compounds/targets, we employed RNA-seq and CCK-8/western blot assays. 
Our results indicated that dinaciclib and alvocidib exhibited similar activity 
and sensitivity in the neuroendocrine cluster. Also, a lineage factor named KLF5 
recognized by inferred transcriptional factors activity could be suppressed by 
verteporfin.

This study investigates the repurposing potential of non-nucleosidic reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), specifically Rilpivirine and Etravirine, as 
L858R/T790M tyrosine kinase inhibitors for addressing acquired resistance in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using in silico molecular docking, 
Rilpivirine demonstrated a docking score of -7.534 kcal/mol, comparable to 
established epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR 
TKIs) like Osimertinib and WZ4002. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over 
200 ns revealed the stability of the Rilpivirine-EGFR complex, with RMSD values 
ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 Å. The in vitro antiproliferative assays showed that 
Rilpivirine had an IC50 value of 2.3 µM against H1975 cells, while WZ4002 had an 
IC50 of 0.291 µM, indicating moderate efficacy. Enzymatic assays revealed that 
Rilpivirine inhibited the double mutant epidermal growth factor receptor 
tyrosine kinase (EGFR TK) with an IC50 value of 54.22 nM and spared the 
wild-type EGFR TK with an IC50 of 22.52 nM. These findings suggest Rilpivirine's 
potential as a therapeutic agent for NSCLC with EGFR L858R/T790M mutations.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has been observed to have significant sex 
differences in incidence, prognosis, and response to therapy. However, the 
molecular mechanisms responsible for these disparities have not been 
investigated extensively.
METHODS: Sample-specific gene regulatory network methods were used to analyze 
RNA sequencing data from non-cancerous human lung samples from The Genotype 
Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) and lung adenocarcinoma primary tumor samples 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); results were validated on independent data.
RESULTS: We found that genes associated with key biological pathways including 
cell proliferation, immune response and drug metabolism are differentially 
regulated between males and females in both healthy lung tissue and tumor, and 
that these regulatory differences are further perturbed by tobacco smoking. We 
also discovered significant sex bias in transcription factor targeting patterns 
of clinically actionable oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, including AKT2 
and KRAS. Using differentially regulated genes between healthy and tumor samples 
in conjunction with a drug repurposing tool, we identified several 
small-molecule drugs that might have sex-biased efficacy as cancer therapeutics 
and further validated this observation using an independent cell line database.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of including sex as a 
biological variable and considering gene regulatory processes in developing 
strategies for disease prevention and management.

Plain Language Summary: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a disease that affects 
males and females differently. Biological sex not only influences chances of 
developing the disease, but also how the disease progresses and how effective 
various therapies may be. We analyzed sex-specific gene regulatory networks 
consisting of transcription factors and the genes they regulate in both healthy 
lung tissue and in LUAD and identified sex-biased differences. We found that 
genes associated with cell proliferation, immune response, and drug metabolism 
are differentially targeted by transcription factors between males and females. 
We also found that several genes that are drug targets in LUAD, are also 
regulated differently between males and females. Importantly, these differences 
are also influenced by an individual’s smoking history. Extending our analysis 
using a drug repurposing tool, we found candidate drugs with evidence that they 
might work better for one sex or the other. These results demonstrate that 
considering the differences in gene regulation between males and females will be 
essential if we are to develop precision medicine strategies for preventing and 
treating LUAD.

One of the problems resulting from recurrent hyperactivated or mutant epidermal 
growth factor receptors (EGFR) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 
therapeutic resistance. Consequently, this leads to increased expression of 
oncogenic proteins and reduces the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs). This study assessed antiviral drug efficacy as potential anti-EGFR 
agents for NSCLC. We used structure-based virtual screening to evaluate 66 
antiviral drugs thoroughly. The top 6 antiviral drugs exhibiting impressive 
binding energies (i. e. surpassing a threshold of -8.5 kcal mol-1) were 
identified. Subsequent bioactivity analysis and ADMET profiling were performed 
to select the most promising candidates, followed by a molecular dynamic 
simulation. Among the selected antiviral regimens, dolutegravir demonstrated the 
highest docking score (-9.8 kcal mol-1), followed by rilpivirine and 
ensitrelvir, surpassing other candidates and our reference EGFR TKI. Further 
molecular dynamics simulations revealed promising dynamic interactions of 
dolutegravir, ensitrelvir, and rilpivirine with the EGFR target as compared with 
afatinib. Our findings highlight the repositioning potential of antiviral drugs 
for anti-EGFR drug discovery, supported by their robust docking scores, ADMET 
profiles, dynamic interactions, and binding free energies. The results open up 
new avenues for advanced NSCLC therapy. Further in vitro investigations are 
warranted to evaluate their efficacy and safety.

IC Regimen: Delaying Resistance to Lorlatinib in ALK Driven Cancers by Adding 
Repurposed Itraconazole and Cilostazol.

Author information:

Lorlatinib is a pharmaceutical ALK kinase inhibitor used to treat ALK driven 
non-small cell lung cancers. This paper analyses the intersection of past 
published data on the physiological consequences of two unrelated drugs from 
general medical practice-itraconazole and cilostazol-with the pathophysiology of 
ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer. A conclusion from that data analysis is 
that adding itraconazole and cilostazol may make lorlatinib more effective. 
Itraconazole, although marketed worldwide as a generic antifungal drug, also 
inhibits Hedgehog signaling, Wnt signaling, hepatic CYP3A4, and the p-gp efflux 
pump. Cilostazol, marketed worldwide as a generic thrombosis preventative drug, 
acts by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 3, and, by so doing, lowers platelets' 
adhesion, thereby partially depriving malignant cells of the many tumor trophic 
growth factors supplied by platelets. Itraconazole may enhance lorlatinib 
effectiveness by (i) reducing or stopping a Hedgehog-ALK amplifying feedback 
loop, by (ii) increasing lorlatinib's brain levels by p-gp inhibition, and by 
(iii) inhibiting growth drive from Wnt signaling. Cilostazol, surprisingly, 
carries minimal bleeding risk, lower than that of aspirin. Risk/benefit 
assessment of the combination of metastatic ALK positive lung cancer being a 
low-survival disease with the predicted safety of itraconazole-cilostazol 
augmentation of lorlatinib favors a trial of this drug trio in ALK positive lung 
cancer.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been marked as the major cause of death 
in lung cancer patients. Due to tumor heterogeneity, mutation burden, and 
emerging resistance against the available therapies in NSCLC, it has been posing 
potential challenges in the therapy development. Hence, identification of 
cancer-driving mutations and their effective inhibition have been advocated as a 
potential approach in NSCLC treatment. Thereof, this study aims to employ the 
genomic and computational-aided integrative drug repositioning strategy to 
identify the potential mutations in the selected molecular targets and repurpose 
FDA-approved drugs against them. Accordingly, molecular targets and their 
mutations, i.e., EGFR (V843L, L858R, L861Q, and P1019L) and ROS1 (G1969E, 
F2046Y, Y2092C, and V2144I), were identified based on TCGA dataset analysis. 
Following, virtual screening and redocking analysis, Elbasvir, Ledipasvir, and 
Lomitapide drugs for EGFR mutants (>-10.8 kcal/mol) while Indinavir, Ledipasvir, 
Lomitapide, Monteleukast, and Isavuconazonium for ROS1 mutants (>-8.8 kcal/mol) 
were found as putative inhibitors. Furthermore, classical molecular dynamics 
simulation and endpoint binding energy calculation support the considerable 
stability of the selected docked complexes aided by substantial hydrogen bonding 
and hydrophobic interactions in comparison to the respective control complexes. 
Conclusively, the repositioned FDA-approved drugs might be beneficial alone or 
in synergy to overcome acquired resistance to EGFR and ROS1-positive lung 
cancers.

PURPOSE: Systemic treatments given to patients with non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) are often ineffective due to drug resistance. In the present study, we 
investigated patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTO) and matched tumor tissues 
from surgically treated patients with NSCLC to identify drug repurposing targets 
to overcome resistance toward standard-of-care platinum-based doublet 
chemotherapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PDTOs were established from 10 prospectively enrolled 
patients with non-metastatic NSCLC from resected tumors. PDTOs were compared 
with matched tumor tissues by histopathology/immunohistochemistry, whole exome 
sequencing, and transcriptome sequencing. PDTO growths and drug responses were 
determined by measuring 3D tumoroid volumes, cell viability, and 
proliferation/apoptosis. Differential gene expression analysis identified 
drug-repurposing targets. Validations were performed with internal/external data 
sets of patients with NSCLC. NSCLC cell lines were used for aldo-keto reductase 
1B10 (AKR1B10) knockdown studies and xenograft models to determine the 
intratumoral bioavailability of epalrestat.
RESULTS: PDTOs retained histomorphology and pathological biomarker expression, 
mutational/transcriptomic signatures, and cellular heterogeneity of the matched 
tumor tissues. Five (50%) PDTOs were chemoresistant toward 
carboplatin/paclitaxel. Chemoresistant PDTOs and matched tumor tissues 
demonstrated overexpression of AKR1B10. Epalrestat, an orally available AKR1B10 
inhibitor in clinical use for diabetic polyneuropathy, was repurposed to 
overcome chemoresistance of PDTOs. In vivo efficacy of epalrestat to overcome 
drug resistance corresponded to intratumoral epalrestat levels.
CONCLUSIONS: PDTOs are efficient preclinical models recapitulating the tumor 
characteristics and are suitable for drug testing. AKR1B10 can be targeted by 
repurposing epalrestat to overcome chemoresistance in NSCLC. Epalrestat has the 
potential to advance to clinical trials in patients with drug-resistant NSCLC 
due to favorable toxicity, pharmacological profile, and bioavailability.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a significant planetary health challenge with its 
high morbidity and mortality rate, not to mention the marked interindividual 
variability in treatment outcomes and side effects. There is an urgent need for 
robust systems biomarkers that can help with early cancer diagnosis, prediction 
of treatment outcomes, and design of precision/personalized medicines for LUAD. 
The present study aimed at systems biomarkers of LUAD and deployed integrative 
bioinformatics and machine learning tools to harness gene expression data. 
Predictive models were developed to stratify patients based on prognostic 
outcomes. Importantly, we report here several potential key genes, for example, 
PMEL and BRIP1, and pathways implicated in the progression and prognosis of LUAD 
that could potentially be targeted for precision/personalized medicine in the 
future. Our drug repurposing analysis and molecular docking simulations 
suggested eight drug candidates for LUAD such as heat shock protein 90 
inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, an antipsychotic agent (trifluoperazine), and a 
calcium ionophore (ionomycin). In summary, this study identifies several 
promising leads on systems biomarkers and drug candidates for LUAD. The findings 
also attest to the importance of integrative bioinformatics, structural biology 
and machine learning techniques in biomarker discovery, and precision oncology 
research and development.

Lung cancer is among leading causes of death worldwide. The five-year survival 
rate of this disease is extremely low (17.8 %), mainly due to difficult early 
diagnosis and to the limited efficacy of currently available chemotherapeutics. 
This underlines the necessity to develop innovative therapies for lung cancer. 
In this context, drug repurposing represents a viable approach, as it reduces 
the turnaround time of drug development removing costs associated to safety 
testing of new molecular entities. Ribavirin, an antiviral molecule used to 
treat hepatitis C virus infections, is particularly promising as repurposed drug 
for cancer treatment, having shown therapeutic activity against glioblastoma, 
acute myeloid leukemia, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In the present study, we 
thoroughly investigated the in vitro anticancer activity of ribavirin against 
A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. From a functional standpoint, ribavirin 
significantly inhibits cancer hallmarks such as cell proliferation, migration, 
and colony formation. Mechanistically, ribavirin downregulates the expression of 
numerous proteins and genes regulating cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, 
and cancer angiogenesis. The anticancer potential of ribavirin was further 
investigated in silico through gene ontology pathway enrichment and 
protein-protein interaction networks, identifying five putative molecular 
interactors of ribavirin (Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 4 (Erb-B4); KRAS; 
Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1); amphiregulin (AREG); and 
neuregulin-1 (NRG1)). These interactions were characterized via molecular 
docking and molecular dynamic simulations. The results of this study highlight 
the potential of ribavirin as a repurposed chemotherapy against lung cancer, 
warranting further studies to ascertain the in vivo anticancer activity of this 
molecule.

The marine environment provides a rich source of distinct creatures containing 
potentially revolutionary bioactive chemicals. One of these organisms is 
Caulerpa racemosa, a type of green algae known as green seaweed, seagrapes, or 
green caviar. This organism stands out because it has great promise for use in 
medicine, especially in the study of cancer. Through the utilization of 
computational modeling (in silico) and cellular laboratory experiments (in 
vitro), the chemical components included in the green seaweed C. racemosa were 
effectively analyzed, uncovering its capability to treat non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). The study specifically emphasized blocking SRC, STAT3, PIK3CA, 
MAPK1, EGFR, and JAK1 using molecular docking and in vitro. These proteins play 
a crucial role in the EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Resistance pathway in 
NSCLC. The chemical Caulersin (C2) included in C. racemosa extract (CRE) has 
been identified as a potent and effective agent in fighting against non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both in silico and in vitro. CRE and C2 showed a level 
of inhibition similar to that of osimertinib (positive control/NSCLC drug).

BACKGROUND: Drug repurposing provides a cost-effective approach to address the 
need for lung cancer prevention and therapeutics. We aimed to identify 
actionable druggable targets using Mendelian randomization (MR).
METHODS: Summary-level data of gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) 
were sourced from the eQTLGen resource. We procured genetic associations with 
lung cancer and its subtypes from the TRICL, ILCCO studies (discovery) and the 
FinnGen study (replication). We implemented Summary-data-based Mendelian 
Randomization analysis to identify potential therapeutic targets for lung 
cancer. Colocalization analysis was further conducted to assess whether the 
identified signal pairs shared a causal genetic variant.
FINDINGS: In the main analysis dataset, we identified 55 genes that demonstrate 
a causal relationship with lung cancer and its subtypes. However, in the 
replication cohort, only three genes were found to have such a causal 
association with lung cancer and its subtypes, and of these, HYKK (also known as 
AGPHD1) was consistently present in both the primary analysis dataset and the 
replication cohort. Following HEIDI tests and colocalization analyses, it was 
revealed that HYKK (AGPHD1) is associated with an increased risk of squamous 
cell carcinoma of the lung, with an odds ratio and confidence interval of 
OR = 1.28,95%CI = 1.24 to 1.33.
INTERPRETATION: We have found that the HYKK (AGPHD1) gene is associated with an 
increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, suggesting that this gene 
may represent a potential therapeutic target for both the prevention and 
treatment of lung squamous cell carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Vasculogenic mimicry (VM), when microvascular channels are formed by 
cancer cells independent of endothelial cells, often occurs in deep hypoxic 
areas of tumors and contributes to the aggressiveness and metastasis of 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. However, well-developed VM 
inhibitors exhibit inadequate efficacy due to their low drug utilization rate 
and limited deep penetration. Thus, a cost-effective VM inhibition strategy 
needs to be designed for TNBC treatment.
RESULTS: Herein, we designed a low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) and 
matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) dual-responsive nanoplatform termed 
PFP@PDM-PEG for the cost-effective and efficient utilization of the drug 
disulfiram (DSF) as a VM inhibitor. The PFP@PDM-PEG nanodroplets effectively 
penetrated tumors and exhibited substantial accumulation facilitated by PEG 
deshielding in a LIFU-mediated and MMP-2-sensitive manner. Furthermore, upon 
exposure to LIFU irradiation, DSF was released controllably under ultrasound 
imaging guidance. This secure and controllable dual-response DSF delivery 
platform reduced VM formation by inhibiting COL1/pro-MMP-2 activity, thereby 
significantly inhibiting tumor progression and metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the safety of the raw materials, controlled treatment 
process, and reliable repurposing of DSF, this dual-responsive nanoplatform 
represents a novel and effective VM-based therapeutic strategy for TNBC in 
clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: NSCLC is a lethal cancer that is highly prevalent and accounts for 
85% of cases of lung cancer. Conventional cancer treatments, such as 
chemotherapy and radiation, frequently exhibit limited efficacy and notable 
adverse reactions. Therefore, a drug repurposing method is proposed for 
effective NSCLC treatment.
AIMS: This study aims to evaluate candidate drugs that are effective for NSCLC 
at the clinical level using a systems biology and network analysis approach.
METHODS: Differentially expressed genes in transcriptomics data were identified 
using the systems biology and network analysis approaches. A network of gene 
co-expression was developed with the aim of detecting two modules of gene 
co-expression. Following that, the Drug-Gene Interaction Database was used to 
find possible drugs that target important genes within two gene co-expression 
modules linked to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The use of Cytoscape 
facilitated the creation of a drug-gene interaction network. Finally, gene set 
enrichment analysis was done to validate candidate drugs.
RESULTS: Unlike previous research on repositioning drugs for NSCLC, which uses a 
gene co-expression network, this project is the first to research both gene 
co-expression and co-occurrence networks. And the co-occurrence network also 
accounts for differentially expressed genes in cancer cells and their adjacent 
normal cells. For effective management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
drugs that show higher gene regulation and gene affinity within the drug-gene 
interaction network are thought to be important. According to the discourse, 
NSCLC genes have a lot of control over medicines like vincristine, fluorouracil, 
methotrexate, clotrimazole, etoposide, tamoxifen, sorafenib, doxorubicin, and 
pazopanib.
CONCLUSION: Hence, there is a possibility of repurposing these drugs for the 
treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: This study explores the repurposing of Auranofin (AF), an 
anti-rheumatic drug, for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
adenocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Drug repurposing in 
oncology offers a cost-effective and time-efficient approach to developing new 
cancer therapies. Our research focuses on evaluating AF's selective cytotoxicity 
against cancer cells, identifying RNAseq-based biomarkers to predict AF 
response, and finding the most effective co-therapeutic agents for combination 
with AF.
METHODS: Our investigation employed a comprehensive drug screening of AF in 
combination with eleven anticancer agents in cancerous PDAC and NSCLC 
patient-derived organoids (n = 7), and non-cancerous pulmonary organoids 
(n = 2). Additionally, we conducted RNA sequencing to identify potential 
biomarkers for AF sensitivity and experimented with various drug combinations to 
optimize AF's therapeutic efficacy.
RESULTS: The results revealed that AF demonstrates a preferential cytotoxic 
effect on NSCLC and PDAC cancer cells at clinically relevant concentrations 
below 1 µM, sparing normal epithelial cells. We identified Carbonic Anhydrase 12 
(CA12) as a significant RNAseq-based biomarker, closely associated with the 
NF-κB survival signaling pathway, which is crucial in cancer cell response to 
oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that cancer cells with low CA12 
expression are more susceptible to AF treatment. Furthermore, the combination of 
AF with the AKT inhibitor MK2206 was found to be particularly effective, 
exhibiting potent and selective cytotoxic synergy, especially in tumor organoid 
models classified as intermediate responders to AF, without adverse effects on 
healthy organoids.
CONCLUSION: Our research offers valuable insights into the use of AF for 
treating NSCLC and PDAC. It highlights AF's cancer cell selectivity, establishes 
CA12 as a predictive biomarker for AF sensitivity, and underscores the enhanced 
efficacy of AF when combined with MK2206 and other therapeutics. These findings 
pave the way for further exploration of AF in cancer treatment, particularly in 
identifying patient populations most likely to benefit from its use and in 
optimizing combination therapies for improved patient outcomes.

Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors around the world, which 
has the highest mortality rate among all cancers. Traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM) has attracted increased attention in the field of lung cancer treatment. 
However, the abundance of ingredients in Chinese medicines presents a challenge 
in identifying promising ingredient candidates and exploring their mechanisms 
for lung cancer treatment. In this work, two network-based algorithms were 
combined to calculate the network relationships between ingredient targets and 
lung cancer targets in the human interactome. Based on the enrichment analysis 
of the constructed disease module, key targets of lung cancer were identified. 
In addition, molecular docking and enrichment analysis of the overlapping 
targets between lung cancer and ingredients were performed to investigate the 
potential mechanisms of ingredient candidates against lung cancer. Ten potential 
ingredients against lung cancer were identified and they may have similar effect 
on the development of lung cancer. The results obtained from this study offered 
valuable insights and provided potential avenues for the development of novel 
drugs aimed at treating lung cancer.

Cardiovascular/anti-inflammatory drugs repurposed for treating or preventing 
cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.

Francisco, California, United States.

BACKGROUND: Due to encouraging pre-clinical data and supportive observational 
studies, there has been growing interest in applying cardiovascular drugs 
(including aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, statins, and 
metformin) approved to treat diseases such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and 
diabetes mellitus to the field of oncology. Moreover, given growing costs with 
cancer care, these medications have offered a potentially more affordable avenue 
to treat or prevent recurrence of cancer. We sought to investigate the 
anti-cancer effects of drugs repurposed from cardiology or anti-inflammatories 
to treat cancer. We specifically evaluated the following drug classes: HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors (statins), cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, aspirin, metformin, 
and both angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors. We also included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
because they exert a similar mechanism to aspirin by blocking prostaglandins and 
reducing inflammation that is thought to promote the development of cancer.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review using PubMed and Web of 
Science with search terms including ""aspirin,"" ""NSAID,"" ""statin"" (including 
specific statin drug names), ""metformin,"" ""ACE inhibitors,"" and ""ARBs"" 
(including specific anti-hypertensive drug names) in combination with ""cancer."" 
Searches were limited to human studies published between 2000 and 2023.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The number and percentage of studies reported 
positive results and pooled estimates of overall survival, progression-free 
survival, response, and disease-free survival.
RESULTS: We reviewed 3094 titles and included 67 randomized clinical trials. The 
most common drugs that were tested were metformin (n = 21; 30.9%), celecoxib 
(n = 20; 29.4%), and simvastatin (n = 8; 11.8%). There was only one study that 
tested cardiac glycosides and none that studied ACE inhibitors. The most common 
tumor types were non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 19; 27.9%); breast (n = 8; 
20.6%), colorectal (n = 7; 10.3%), and hepatocellular (n = 6; 8.8%). Most 
studies were conducted in a phase II trial (n = 38; 55.9%). Most studies were 
tested in metastatic cancers (n = 49; 72.1%) and in the first-line setting 
(n = 36; 521.9%). Four studies (5.9%) were stopped early because of difficulty 
with accrual. The majority of studies did not demonstrate an improvement in 
either progression-free survival (86.1% of studies testing progression-free 
survival) or in overall survival (94.3% of studies testing overall survival). 
Progression-free survival was improved in five studies (7.4%), and overall 
survival was improved in three studies (4.4%). Overall survival was 
significantly worse in two studies (3.8% of studies testing overall survival), 
and progression-free survival was worse in one study (2.8% of studies testing 
progression-free survival).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite promising pre-clinical and population-based 
data, cardiovascular drugs and anti-inflammatory medications have overall not 
demonstrated benefit in the treatment or preventing recurrence of cancer. These 
findings may help guide future potential clinical trials involving these 
medications when applied in oncology.

BACKGROUND: Due to the limited success in the treatment of lung adenocarcinomas, 
new treatment protocols are urgently needed to increase the curability rate and 
the survival of lung cancer patients.
OBJECTIVES: Although statins, like atorvastatin (Ator), and metformin (Met) are 
widely accepted as hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic drugs, respectively, there are 
many predictions about their enhancing antitumor effect when they are combined 
with traditional chemotherapeutics.
METHODS: The individual and combined antiproliferative potential of Ator and Met 
was tested by MTT-assay in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cell line, 
compared to the corresponding effect of Gemcitabine (Gem) with implication on 
the mechanisms of action.
RESULTS: Initially, both drugs demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity 
in A549 cells. Also, their combination index (CI) indicated their synergistic 
effect at equi-IC50 concentration (CI = 0.00984). Moreover, Ator and/or 
Met-treated cells revealed disrupted patterns of SOD, CAT, GSH, MDA, and TAC, 
developed apoptosis, and larger fractions of the cell population were arrested 
in G0/G1 phase, particularly in cells dually-treated both Ator and Met. These 
observations were accompanied by downregulation in the expression of iNOS, HO-1, 
and the angiogenic marker VEGF, meanwhile, an altered expression of MAPK and 
AMPK was observed.
CONCLUSION: Conclusively, these data suggest that repurposing of Ator and Met 
demonstrates their individual and combined antiproliferative effect in non-small 
cell lung cancer and they may adopt a similar mechanism of action.

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, whereby the major 
contributing factors are cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental 
pollutants. Despite the availability of numerous treatment options, including 
chemotherapy, the five-year survival rate is still extremely low, highlighting 
the urgent need to develop novel, more effective therapeutic strategies. In this 
context, the repurposing of previously approved drugs is an advantage in terms 
of time and resources invested. Ribavirin is an antiviral drug approved for the 
treatment of hepatitis C, which shows potential for repurposing as an anticancer 
agent. Among the many signaling molecules promoting carcinogenesis, the 
interleukins (ILs) IL-6 and IL-8 are interesting therapeutic targets as they 
promote a variety of cancer hallmarks such as cell proliferation, migration, 
metastasis, and angiogenesis. In the present study, we show that ribavirin 
significantly downregulates the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in vitro in A549 
human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The results of this study shed light on the 
anticancer mechanisms of ribavirin, providing further proof of its potential as 
a repurposed drug for the treatment of lung cancer.

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. Although current 
treatments can increase patient survival, they are rarely curative when the 
disease is advanced (metastasis). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop 
new cytotoxic drugs with a high selectivity toward cancer cells. Since 
repurposing approved drugs for cancer therapy has been a successful strategy in 
recent years, in this study, we screened a library of antiviral 
piperazine-derived compounds as anticancer agents. The compounds included a 
piperazine ring and aryl urea functions, which are privileged structures present 
in several anti-breast cancer drugs. The selective cytotoxic activity of a set 
of thirty-four 4-acyl-2-substituted piperazine urea derivatives against MCF7 
breast cancer cells and MCF 10A normal breast cells was determined. Compounds 
31, 32, 35, and 37 showed high selective anticancer activity against breast 
cancer cells and were also tested against another common type of cancer, 
non-small cell lung cancer (A549 lung cancer cells versus MRC-5 lung normal 
cells). Compounds 35 and 37 also showed selectivity against lung cancer cells. 
These results suggest that compounds 35 and 37 may be promising hit compounds 
for the development of new anticancer agents.

Lung cancer, primarily non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is a significant 
cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a 
standard treatment for NSCLC; however, its effectiveness is often limited due to 
the development of resistance, leading to NSCLC recurrence. Thus, the 
identification of effective chemosensitizers for cisplatin is of paramount 
importance. The integrated stress response (ISR), activated by various cellular 
stresses and mediated by eIF2α kinases, has been implicated in drug sensitivity. 
ISR activation globally suppresses protein synthesis while selectively promoting 
the translation of ATF4 mRNA, which can induce pro-apoptotic proteins such as 
CHOP, ATF3, and TRIB3. To expedite and economize the development of 
chemosensitizers for cisplatin treatment in NSCLC, we employed a strategy to 
screen an FDA-approved drug library for ISR activators. In this study, we 
identified mifepristone as a potent ISR activator. Mifepristone activated the 
HRI/eIF2α/ATF4 axis, leading to the induction of pro-apoptotic factors, 
independent of its known role as a synthetic steroid. Our in vitro and in vivo 
models demonstrated mifepristone's potential to inhibit NSCLC re-proliferation 
following cisplatin treatment and tumor growth, respectively, via the 
ISR-mediated cell death pathway. These findings suggest that mifepristone, as an 
ISR activator, could enhance the efficacy of cisplatin-based therapy for NSCLC, 
highlighting the potential of drug repositioning in the search for effective 
chemosensitizers.

Drug repositioning seeks to leverage existing clinical knowledge to identify 
alternative clinical settings for approved drugs. However, repositioning efforts 
fail to demonstrate improved success rates in late-stage clinical trials. 
Focusing on 11 approved kinase inhibitors that have been evaluated in 139 
repositioning hypotheses, we use data mining to characterize the state of 
clinical repurposing. Then, using a simple experimental correction with human 
serum proteins in in vitro pharmacodynamic assays, we develop a measurement of a 
drug's effective exposure. We show that this metric is remarkably predictive of 
clinical activity for a panel of five kinase inhibitors across 23 drug variant 
targets in leukemia. We then validate our model's performance in six other 
kinase inhibitors for two types of solid tumors: non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Our approach presents a 
straightforward strategy to use existing clinical information and experimental 
systems to decrease the clinical failure rate in drug repurposing studies.

Drug combinations are key to circumvent resistance mechanisms compromising 
response to single anti-cancer targeted therapies. The implementation of 
combinatorial approaches involving MEK1/2 or KRASG12C inhibitors in the context 
of KRAS-mutated lung cancers focuses fundamentally on targeting KRAS proximal 
activators or effectors. However, the antitumor effect is highly determined by 
compensatory mechanisms arising in defined cell types or tumor subgroups. A 
potential strategy to find drug combinations targeting a larger fraction of 
KRAS-mutated lung cancers may capitalize on the common, distal gene expression 
output elicited by oncogenic KRAS. By integrating a signature-driven drug 
repurposing approach with a pairwise pharmacological screen, here we show 
synergistic drug combinations consisting of multi-tyrosine kinase PKC inhibitors 
together with MEK1/2 or KRASG12C inhibitors. Such combinations elicit a 
cytotoxic response in both in vitro and in vivo models, which in part involves 
inhibition of the PKC inhibitor target AURKB. Proteome profiling links 
dysregulation of MYC expression to the effect of both PKC inhibitor-based drug 
combinations. Furthermore, MYC overexpression appears as a resistance mechanism 
to MEK1/2 and KRASG12C inhibitors. Our study provides a rational framework for 
selecting drugs entering combinatorial strategies and unveils MEK1/2- and 
KRASG12C-based therapies for lung cancer.

Globally, lung cancer contributes significantly to the public health 
burden-associated mortality. As this form of cancer is insidious in nature, 
there is an inevitable diagnostic delay leading to chronic tumor development. 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes 80-85% of all lung cancer cases, 
making this neoplasia form a prevalent subset of lung carcinoma. One of the most 
vital aspects for proper diagnosis, prognosis, and adequate therapy is the 
precise classification of non-small cell lung cancer based on biomarker 
expression profiling. This form of biomarker profiling has provided 
opportunities for improvements in patient stratification, mechanistic insights, 
and probable druggable targets. However, numerous patients have exhibited 
numerous toxic side effects, tumor relapse, and development of therapy-based 
chemoresistance. As a result of these exacting situations, there is a dire need 
for efficient and effective new cancer therapeutics. De novo drug development 
approach is a costly and tedious endeavor, with an increased attrition rate, 
attributed, in part, to toxicity-related issues. Drug repurposing, on the other 
hand, when combined with computer-assisted systems biology approach, provides 
alternatives to the discovery of new, efficacious, and safe drugs. Therefore, in 
this review, we focus on a comparison of the conventional therapy-based 
chemoresistance mechanisms with the repurposed anti-cancer drugs from three 
different classes-anti-parasitic, anti-depressants, and anti-psychotics for 
cancer treatment with a primary focus on NSCLC therapeutics. Certainly, 
amalgamating these novel therapeutic approaches with that of the conventional 
drug regimen in NSCLC-affected patients will possibly complement/synergize the 
existing therapeutic modalities. This approach has tremendous translational 
significance, since it can combat drug resistance and cytotoxicity-based side 
effects and provides a relatively new strategy for possible application in 
therapy of individuals with NSCLC.

Drug repurposing based on differentially expressed genes suggests drug 
combinations with possible synergistic effects in treatment of lung 
adenocarcinoma.

Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Lung adenocarcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality 
globally. Various treatment approaches and drugs had little influence on overall 
survival; thus, new drugs and treatment strategies are needed. Drug 
repositioning (repurposing) seems a favorable approach considering that 
developing new drugs needs much more time and costs. We performed a 
meta-analysis on 6 microarray datasets to obtain the main genes with 
significantly altered expression in lung adenocarcinoma. Following that, we 
found major gene clusters and hub genes. We assessed their enrichment in 
biological pathways to get insight into the underlying biological process 
involved in lung adenocarcinoma pathogenesis. The L1000 database was explored 
for drug perturbations that might reverse the expression of differentially 
expressed genes in lung adenocarcinoma. We evaluated the potential drug 
combinations that interact the most with hub genes and hence have the most 
potential to reverse the disease process. A total of 2148 differentially 
expressed genes were identified. Six main gene clusters and 27 significant hub 
genes mainly involved in cell cycle regulation have been identified. By 
assessing the interaction between 3 drugs and hub genes and information gained 
from previous clinical investigations, we suggested the three possible 
repurposed drug combinations, Vorinostat - Dorsomorphin, PP-110 - Dorsomorphin, 
and Puromycin - Vorinostat with a high chance of success in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Despite recent progress in drug development, lung cancer remains a 
complex disease that poses a major public health issue worldwide, and new 
therapeutic strategies are urgently needed because of the failure of standard 
treatments. Ion channels play a critical role in various cellular processes that 
regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death.
OBJECTIVES: The potential of ion channel modulators as tumor growth suppressors 
has been highlighted in recent studies. Therefore, we hypothesized that 
hydroquinidine (HQ), a previously understudied potassium channel modulator, 
might have anticarcinogenic activity against A549 cells.
METHODS: The anticancer potential of HQ was investigated using various 
wellestablished in vitro assays.
RESULTS: HQ significantly decreased colony formation and tumorigenicity and 
exhibited a significant anti-migratory effect in A549 cells. Our results 
demonstrated that HQ significantly inhibited the growth of cancer cells by 
decreasing the proliferation rate while increasing cell death. The altered gene 
expression profile in response to treatment with HQ was consistent with the 
observed cellular effects. Incubation of cells with HQ resulted in the 
downregulation of genes involved in cell division and survival, while genes 
promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were upregulated.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HQ has the potential to limit lung cancer 
growth as a novel potent anticarcinogenic agent. However, more investigations 
are needed to gain further insight into the mechanism of action of HQ and to 
evaluate its efficacy in invivo models.

Lung cancer is managed using conventional therapies, including chemotherapy, 
radiation therapy, or a combination of both. Each of these therapies has its own 
limitations, such as the indiscriminate killing of normal as well as cancer 
cells, the solubility of the chemotherapeutic drugs, rapid clearance of the 
drugs from circulation before reaching the tumor site, the resistance of cancer 
cells to radiation, and over-sensitization of normal cells to radiation. Other 
treatment modalities include gene therapy, immunological checkpoint inhibitors, 
drug repurposing, and in situ cryo-immune engineering (ICIE) strategy. 
Nanotechnology has come to the rescue to overcome many shortfalls of 
conventional therapies. Some of the nano-formulated chemotherapeutic drugs, as 
well as nanoparticles and nanostructures with surface modifications, have been 
used for effective cancer cell killing and radio sensitization, respectively. 
Nano-enabled drug delivery systems act as cargo to deliver the sensitizer 
molecules specifically to the tumor cells, thereby enabling the radiation 
therapy to be more effective. In this review, we have discussed the different 
conventional chemotherapies and radiation therapies used for inhibiting lung 
cancer. We have also discussed the improvement in chemotherapy and radiation 
sensitization using nanoparticles.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related 
deaths worldwide. Drug repurposing and nano-drug delivery systems are attracting 
considerable attention for improving anti-cancer therapy. Sertaconazole (STZ), 
an antifungal agent, has been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against both 
normal and tumor cells, and its medical use is limited by its poor solubility. 
In order to overcome such shortcomings, we prepared a drug-repurposed 
nanoplatform to enhance the anti-tumor efficiency.
METHODS: Nanoplatform was prepared by thin film dispersion. Drug release studies 
and uptake studies were measured in vitro. Subsequently, we verified the tumor 
inhibition mechanisms of HTS NPs through apoptosis assay, immunoblotting and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection analyses. Antitumor activity was 
evaluated on an established xenograft lung cancer model in vivo.
RESULTS: Our nanoplatform improved the solubility of sertaconazole and increased 
its accumulation in tumor cells. Mechanistically, HTS NPs was dependent on 
ROS-mediated apoptosis and pro-apoptotic autophagy to achieve their excellent 
anti-tumor effects. Furthermore, HTS NPs also showed strong inhibitory ability 
in nude mouse xenograft models without significant side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that sertaconazole-repurposed nanoplatform 
provides an effective strategy for lung cancer treatment.

Drug repurposing is proved to be a groundbreaking concept in the field of cancer 
research, accelerating the pace of de novo drug discovery by investigating the 
anti-cancer activity of the already approved drugs. On the other hand, it got 
highly benefitted from the advancement in the in-silico tools and techniques, 
which are used to build up the initial ""proof of concept"" based on the 
drug-target interaction. Acalabrutinib (ACL) is a well-known drug for the 
treatment of hematological malignancies. But, the therapeutic ability of ACL 
against solid tumors is still unexplored. Thereby, the activity of ACL on breast 
cancer and lung cancer was evaluated utilizing different computational methods. 
A series of proteins such as VEGFR1, ALK, BCL2, CXCR-4, mTOR, AKT, PI3K, HER-2, 
and Estrogen receptors were selected based on their involvement in the 
progression of the breast as well as lung cancer. A multi-level computational 
study starting from protein-ligand docking to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations 
were performed to detect the binding potential of ACL towards the selected 
proteins. Results of the study led to the identification of ACL as a ligand that 
showed a high docking score and binding energy with HER-2, mTOR, and VEGFR-1 
successively. Whereas, the MD simulations study has also shown good docked 
complex stability of ACL with HER2 and VEGFR1. Our findings suggest that 
interaction with those receptors can lead to preventive action on both breast 
and lung cancer, thus it can be concluded that ACL could be a potential molecule 
for the same purpose.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) ± chemotherapy is the standard treatment for 
driver mutation-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, 
accessibility to ICIs in LMICs is limited due to high cost, and platinum-based 
chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Metformin has anticancer 
properties, and studies suggest synergism between metformin and pemetrexed. 
Based on preclinical evidence, this combination may be more beneficial for 
STK11-mutated NSCLC, a subgroup, inherently resistant to ICIs. In this Simon 
two-stage, single-arm phase 2 trial, we investigated metformin with 
pemetrexed-carboplatin (PC) in patients with treatment-naive stage IV 
non-squamous NSCLC. The primary outcome was 6-month progression-free survival 
(PFS) rate. Secondary outcomes were safety, overall survival (OS), overall 
response rate (ORR), proportion of STK11 mutation, and effect of STK11 mutation 
on 6-month PFS rate. The study was terminated for futility after interim 
analysis. The median follow-up was 34.1 months. The 6-month PFS rate was 28% 
(95% CI 12.4-0.46). The median PFS and OS were 4.5 (95% CI 2.2-6.1) and 
7.4 months (95% CI 5.3-15.3), respectively. The ORR was 72%. Gastrointestinal 
toxicities were the most common. No grade 4/5 toxicities were reported. Targeted 
sequencing was possible in nine cases. Two patients had STK11 mutation and a 
poor outcome (PFS < 12 weeks). We could not demonstrate the benefit of metformin 
with CP in terms of improvement in 6-month PFS rate; however, the combination 
was safe (CTRI/2019/02/017815).

Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) are the predominant form of lung 
malignancy and the reason for the highest number of cancer-related deaths. 
Widespread deregulation of Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, has been reported in 
NSCLC. Allosteric Akt inhibitors bind in the space separating the Pleckstrin 
homology (PH) and catalytic domains, typically with tryptophan residue (Trp-80). 
This could decrease the regulatory site phosphorylation by stabilizing the PH-in 
conformation. Hence, in this study, a computational investigation was undertaken 
to identify allosteric Akt-1 inhibitors from FDA-approved drugs. The molecules 
were docked at standard precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP), followed by 
Prime molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA), and molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations on selected hits. Post XP-docking, fourteen best hits 
were identified from a library of 2115 optimized FDA-approved compounds, 
demonstrating several beneficial interactions such as pi-pi stacking, pi-cation, 
direct, and water-bridged hydrogen bonds with the crucial residues (Trp-80 and 
Tyr-272) and several amino acid residues in the allosteric ligand-binding pocket 
of Akt-1. Subsequent MD simulations to verify the stability of chosen drugs to 
the Akt-1 allosteric site showed valganciclovir, dasatinib, indacaterol, and 
novobiocin to have high stability. Further, predictions for possible biological 
interactions were performed using computational tools such as ProTox-II, 
CLC-Pred, and PASSOnline. The shortlisted drugs open a new class of allosteric 
Akt-1 inhibitors for the therapy of NSCLC.

The pathophysiology of lung cancer is dependent on the dysregulation in the 
apoptotic and autophagic pathways. The intricate link between apoptosis and 
autophagy through shared signaling pathways complicates our understanding of how 
lung cancer pathophysiology is regulated. As drug resistance is the primary 
reason behind treatment failure, it is crucial to understand how cancer cells 
may respond to different therapies and integrate crosstalk between apoptosis and 
autophagy in response to them, leading to cell death or survival. Thus, in this 
study, we have tried to evaluate the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis 
in A549 lung cancer cell line that could be modulated by employing a combination 
therapy of metformin (6 mM), an anti-diabetic drug, with gedunin (12 µM), an 
Hsp90 inhibitor, to provide insights into the development of new cancer 
therapeutics. Our results demonstrated that metformin and gedunin were cytotoxic 
to A549 lung cancer cells. Combination of metformin and gedunin generated ROS 
and promoted MMP loss and DNA damage. The combination further increased the 
expression of AMPKα1 and promoted the nuclear localization of AMPKα1/α2. The 
expression of Hsp90 was downregulated, further decreasing the expression of its 
clients, EGFR, PIK3CA, AKT1, and AKT3. Inhibition of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway 
upregulated TP53 and inhibited autophagy. The combination was promoting nuclear 
localization of p53; however, some cytoplasmic signals were also detected. 
Further increase in the expression of caspase 9 and caspase 3 was observed. 
Thus, we concluded that the combination of metformin and gedunin upregulates 
apoptosis by inhibiting the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway and autophagy in A549 lung 
cancer cells.

Autoimmune disorders and some types of blood cancer originate when B lymphocytes 
malfunction. In particular, when B cells produce antibodies recognizing the 
body's proteins, it leads to various autoimmune disorders. Additionally, when B 
cells of various developmental stages transform into cancer cells, it results in 
blood cancers, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia. Thus, new 
methods of targeting B cells are required for various patient groups. Here, we 
used protein kinase inhibitors alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, 
entrectinib, and lorlatinib previously approved as drugs treating anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lung cancer cells. We hypothesized that the same 
inhibitors will efficiently target leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK)-positive, 
actively protein-secreting mature B lymphocytes, including plasma cells. We 
isolated CD19-positive human B cells from the blood of healthy donors and used 
two alternative methods to stimulate cell maturation toward plasma cells. Using 
cell proliferation and flow cytometry assays, we found that ceritinib and 
entrectinib eliminate plasma cells from B cell populations. Alectinib, 
brigatinib, and crizotinib also inhibited B cell proliferation, while lorlatinib 
had no or limited effect on B cells. More generally, we concluded that several 
drugs previously developed to treat ALK-positive malignant cells can be also 
used to treat LTK-positive B cells.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the one of the most common subtypes in 
lung cancer. Although various targeted therapies have been used in the clinical 
practice, the 5-year overall survival rate of patients is still low. Thus, it is 
urgent to identify new therapeutic targets and develop new drugs for the 
treatment of the LUAD patients.
METHODS: Survival analysis was used to identify the prognostic genes. Gene 
co-expression network analysis was used to identify the hub genes driving the 
tumor development. A profile-based drug repositioning approach was used to 
repurpose the potentially useful drugs for targeting the hub genes. MTT and LDH 
assay were used to measure the cell viability and drug cytotoxicity, 
respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression of the proteins.
FINDINGS: We identified 341 consistent prognostic genes from two independent 
LUAD cohorts, whose high expression was associated with poor survival outcomes 
of patients. Among them, eight genes were identified as hub genes due to their 
high centrality in the key functional modules in the gene-co-expression network 
analysis and these genes were associated with the various hallmarks of cancer 
(e.g., DNA replication and cell cycle). We performed drug repositioning analysis 
for three of the eight genes (CDCA8, MCM6, and TTK) based on our drug 
repositioning approach. Finally, we repurposed five drugs for inhibiting the 
protein expression level of each target gene and validated the drug efficacy by 
performing in vitro experiments.
INTERPRETATION: We found the consensus targetable genes for the treatment of 
LUAD patients with different races and geographic characteristics. We also 
proved the feasibility of our drug repositioning approach for the development of 
new drugs for disease treatment.

PURPOSE: Cisplatin is the core chemotherapeutic drug used for first-line 
treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, drug 
resistance is severely hindering its clinical efficacy. This study investigated 
the circumvention of cisplatin resistance by repurposing non-oncology drugs with 
putative histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory effect.
METHODS: A few clinically approved drugs were identified by a computational drug 
repurposing tool called ""DRUGSURV"" and evaluated for HDAC inhibition. 
Triamterene, originally indicated as a diuretic, was chosen for further 
investigation in pairs of parental and cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cell lines. 
Sulforhodamine B assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. Western blot 
analysis was performed to examine histone acetylation. Flow cytometry was used 
to examine apoptosis and cell cycle effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was 
conducted to investigate the interaction of transcription factors to the 
promoter of genes regulating cisplatin uptake and cell cycle progression. The 
circumvention of cisplatin resistance by triamterene was further verified in a 
patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) from a cisplatin-refractory NSCLC patient.
RESULTS: Triamterene was found to inhibit HDACs. It was shown to enhance 
cellular cisplatin accumulation and potentiate cisplatin-induced cell cycle 
arrest, DNA damage, and apoptosis. Mechanistically, triamterene was found to 
induce histone acetylation in chromatin, thereby reducing the association of 
HDAC1 but promoting the interaction of Sp1 with the gene promoter of hCTR1 and 
p21. Triamterene was further shown to potentiate the anti-cancer effect of 
cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant PDX in vivo.
CONCLUSION: The findings advocate further clinical evaluation of the repurposing 
use of triamterene to overcome cisplatin resistance.

Oral anticancer therapy mostly faces the challenges of low aqueous solubility, 
poor and irregular absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, food-influenced 
absorption, high first-pass metabolism, non-targeted delivery, and severe 
systemic and local adverse effects. Interest has been growing in bioactive 
self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (bio-SNEDDSs) using lipid-based 
excipients within nanomedicine. This study aimed to develop novel bio-SNEDDS to 
deliver antiviral remdesivir and baricitinib for the treatment of breast and 
lung cancers. Pure natural oils used in bio-SNEDDS were analyzed using GC-MS to 
examine bioactive constituents. The initial evaluation of bio-SNEDDSs were 
performed based on self-emulsification assessment, particle size analysis, zeta 
potential, viscosity measurement, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
The single and combined anticancer effects of remdesivir and baricitinib in 
different bio-SNEDDS formulations were investigated in MDA-MB-231 (breast 
cancer) and A549 (lung cancer) cell lines. The results from the GC-MS analysis 
of bioactive oils BSO and FSO showed pharmacologically active constituents, such 
as thymoquinone, isoborneol, paeonol and p-cymenene, and squalene, respectively. 
The representative F5 bio-SNEDDSs showed relatively uniform, nanosized (247 nm) 
droplet along with acceptable zeta potential values (+29 mV). The viscosity of 
the F5 bio-SNEDDS was recorded within 0.69 Cp. The TEM suggested uniform 
spherical droplets upon aqueous dispersions. Drug-free, remdesivir and 
baricitinib-loaded bio-SNEDDSs (combined) showed superior anticancer effects 
with IC50 value that ranged from 1.9-4.2 µg/mL (for breast cancer), 2.4-5.8 
µg/mL (for lung cancer), and 3.05-5.44 µg/mL (human fibroblasts cell line). In 
conclusion, the representative F5 bio-SNEDDS could be a promising candidate for 
improving the anticancer effect of remdesivir and baricitinib along with their 
existing antiviral performance in combined dosage form.

TMEM16A, a Ca2+-activated chloride channel (CaCC), and its pharmacological 
inhibitors can inhibit the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells. However,the poor 
efficacy, safety, and stability of TMEM16A inhibitors limit the development of 
these agents. Therefore, finding new therapeutic directions from already 
marketed drugs is a feasible strategy to obtain safe and effective therapeutic 
drugs. Here, we screened a library contain more than 2400 FDA, EMA, and 
NMPA-approved drugs through virtual screening. We identified a drug candidate, 
candesartan (CDST), which showed strong inhibitory effect on the TMEM16A in a 
concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 24.40 ± 3.21 μM. In addition, 
CDST inhibited proliferation, migration and induced apoptosis of LA795 cells 
targeting TMEM16A, and significantly inhibited lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth 
in vivo. The molecular mechanism of CDST inhibiting TMEM16A channel indicated it 
bound to R515/R535/E623/E624 in the drug pocket, thereby blocked the pore. In 
conclusion, we identified a novel TMEM16A channel inhibitor, CDST, which 
exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against lung adenocarcinoma. Considering 
that CDST has been used in clinical treatment of hypertension, it may play an 
important role in the combined treatment of hypertension and lung adenocarcinoma 
as a multi-target drug in the future.

emerging as putative cancer drugs. Their unique chemical structure enables CADs 
to accumulate rapidly inside lysosomes, where they increase lysosomal pH, alter 
lysosomal lipid metabolism, and eventually cause lysosomal membrane 
permeabilization. Here, we show that CAD-induced rapid elevation in lysosomal pH 
is caused by a lysosomal H+ efflux that requires P2RX4-mediated lysosomal Ca2+ 
release and precedes the lysosomal membrane permeabilization. The subsequent 
cytosolic acidification triggers the dephosphorylation, lysosomal translocation, 
and inactivation of the oncogenic signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor. Moreover, CAD-induced lysosomal H+ 
efflux sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis induced by STAT3 inhibition and acts 
synergistically with STAT3 inhibition in restricting the tumor growth of A549 
non-small cell lung carcinoma xenografts. These findings identify lysosomal H+ 
efflux and STAT3 inhibition as anticancer mechanisms of CADs and reinforce the 
repurposing of safe and inexpensive CADs as cancer drugs with a drug combination 
strategy.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and EGFR 
mutation is the most common genetic alteration among Asian patients with lung 
adenocarcinoma. While osimertinib has been shown to be effective in lung cancer 
patients with EGFR mutation, the majority of patients eventually develop 
acquired resistance to treatment. We explored the significance of the cyclin D1 
expression in patients with EGFR mutation and the potential efficacy of adding 
abemaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, simultaneously with 
osimertinib in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining, using an anti-cyclin D1 
antibody, of specimens from 83 patients with EGFR mutation (male, n = 27; pStage 
0-I, n = 71) who were treated by surgical resection between 2017 and 2020, and 
the relationship between the cyclin D1 expression and clinicopathological 
factors was analyzed. Additionally, the combined effect of osimertinib and 
abemaciclib in lung cancer cell lines were analyzed using a growth inhibition 
test, and the signaling pathway underlying the combined effect was investigated.
RESULTS: Cyclin D1 was negative in 18.1% of patients with EGFR mutation, and 
cyclin D1 negativity was associated with pStage ≥ II (p = 0.02), lymph node 
metastasis (p = 0.001), and lymphatic invasion (p = 0.01). The cyclin 
D1-negative group had significantly shorter recurrence-free survival (p = 0.02), 
although this difference disappeared when limited to pN0 patients. In EGFR 
mutated cell lines, the combination of osimertinib and abemaciclib demonstrated 
synergistic effects, which were thought to be mediated by the inhibition of AKT 
phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors and EGFR-TKIs may be a 
promising approach.

Novel drugs are desperately needed in order to combat a significant challenge 
due to chemo-therapeutic resistance and bad prognosis. This research aimed to 
assess the anticancer activity of a newly synthesized ciprofloxacin Mannich base 
(CMB) on ovarian cancer (OVCAR-3) and lung cancer (A-549) cell lines and to 
investigate probable involved molecular mechanisms. The cytotoxic and 
pro-apoptotic impact of CMB on both cell lines was investigated using MTT assay, 
Annexin V assay, and cell cycle analysis, as well as caspase-3 activation. 
Western blotting was carried out to evaluate downstream targets of the MAPK 
pathway, while qRT PCR was used to evaluate the gene expression pattern of the 
p53/Bax/Bcl2 pathway. CMB treatment showed significantly reduced cell 
proliferation in both OVCAR-3 and A-549 cells with half maximum inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) = 11.60 and 16.22 µg/mL, respectively. CMB also induced 
apoptosis, S phase cell cycle arrest, and up-regulated expression of p53, p21, 
and Bax while down-regulated Bcl2 expression. CMB also halted cell proliferation 
by deactivating the MAPK pathway. In conclusion, CMB may be regarded as a 
potential antiproliferative agent for lung and ovarian cancers due to 
anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic actions via inhibition of the MAPK pathway 
and p53/Bax/Bcl2.

Drug repositioning aims to discover novel clinical benefits of existing drugs, 
is an effective way to develop drugs for complex diseases such as cancer and may 
facilitate the process of traditional drug development. Meanwhile, network-based 
computational biology approaches, which allow the integration of information 
from different aspects to understand the relationships between biomolecules, has 
been successfully applied to drug repurposing. In this work, we developed a new 
strategy for network-based drug repositioning against cancer. Combining the 
mechanism of action and clinical efficacy of the drugs, a cancer-related drug 
similarity network was constructed, and the correlation score of each drug with 
a specific cancer was quantified. The top 5% of scoring drugs were reviewed for 
stability and druggable potential to identify potential repositionable drugs. Of 
the 11 potentially repurposable drugs for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10 
were confirmed by clinical trial articles and databases. The targets of these 
drugs were significantly enriched in cancer-related pathways and significantly 
associated with the prognosis of NSCLC. In light of the successful application 
of our approach to colorectal cancer as well, it provides an effective clue and 
valuable perspective for drug repurposing in cancer.

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of 
cancer-related deaths in 2022. The majority (80%) of lung cancer cases belong to 
the non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) subtype. Despite the increased 
screening efforts, the median five-year survival of metastatic NSCLC remains low 
at approximately 3%. Common treatment approaches for NSCLC include surgery, 
multimodal chemotherapy, and concurrent radio and chemotherapy. NSCLC exhibits 
high rates of resistance to treatment, driven by its heterogeneity and the 
plasticity of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Drug repurposing offers a faster and 
cheaper way to develop new antineoplastic purposes for existing drugs, to help 
overcome therapy resistance. The decrease in time and funds needed stems from 
the availability of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to be repurposed. This review 
provides a synopsis of the drug-repurposing approaches and mechanisms of action 
of potential candidate drugs used in treating NSCLC, including but not limited 
to antihypertensives, anti-hyperlipidemics, anti-inflammatory drugs, 
anti-diabetics, and anti-microbials.

The Kirsten rat sarcoma viral G12C (KRASG12C) protein is one of the most common 
mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRASG12C inhibitors are 
promising for NSCLC treatment, but their weaker activity in resistant tumors is 
their drawback. This study aims to identify new KRASG12C inhibitors from among 
the FDA-approved covalent drugs by taking advantage of artificial intelligence. 
The machine learning models were constructed using an extreme gradient boosting 
(XGBoost) algorithm. The models can predict KRASG12C inhibitors well, with an 
accuracy score of validation = 0.85 and Q2Ext = 0.76. From 67 FDA-covalent 
drugs, afatinib, dacomitinib, acalabrutinib, neratinib, zanubrutinib, 
dutasteride, and finasteride were predicted to be active inhibitors. Afatinib 
obtained the highest predictive log-inhibitory concentration at 50% (pIC50) 
value against KRASG12C protein close to the KRASG12C inhibitors. Only afatinib, 
neratinib, and zanubrutinib covalently bond at the active site like the KRASG12C 
inhibitors in the KRASG12C protein (PDB ID: 6OIM). Moreover, afatinib, 
neratinib, and zanubrutinib exhibited a distance deviation between the KRASG2C 
protein-ligand complex similar to the KRASG12C inhibitors. Therefore, afatinib, 
neratinib, and zanubrutinib could be used as drug candidates against the 
KRASG12C protein. This finding unfolds the benefit of artificial intelligence in 
drug repurposing against KRASG12C protein.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of mortality and 
morbidity worldwide accounting about 85% of total lung cancer cases. The 
receptor REarranged during Transfection (RET) plays an important role by ligand 
independent activation of kinase domain resulting in carcinogenesis. Presently, 
the treatment for RET driven NSCLC is limited to multiple kinase inhibitors. 
This situation necessitates the discovery of novel and potent RET specific 
inhibitors. Thus, we employed high throughput screening strategy to repurpose 
FDA approved compounds from DrugBank comprising of 2509 molecules. It is worth 
noting that the initial screening is accomplished with the aid of in-house 
machine learning model built using IC50 values corresponding to 2854 compounds 
obtained from BindingDB repository. A total of 497 compounds (19%) were 
predicted as actives by our generated model. Subsequent in silico validation 
process such as molecular docking, MMGBSA and density function theory analysis 
resulted in identification of two lead compounds named DB09313 and DB00471. The 
simulation study highlights the potency of DB00471 (Montelukast) as potential 
RET inhibitor among the investigated compounds. In the end, the half-minimal 
inhibitory activity of montelukast was also predicted against RET protein 
expressing LC-2/ad cell lines demonstrated significant anticancer activity. 
Collective analysis from our study highlights that montelukast could be a 
promising candidate for the management of RET specific NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a major threat to public health and remains difficult 
to treat. Repositioning of existing drugs has emerged as a therapeutic strategy 
in lung cancer. Clinically, low-dose montelukast has been used to treat asthma.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the potential of using montelukast to treat lung cancer.
METHODS: Migration was detected using wound-healing and Transwell assays, the 
expression of CysLT1 using western blotting, and subcellular localization of 
CysLT1 using immunofluorescence. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to further 
investigate the function of CysLT1.
RESULTS: Subcellular localization staining showed that the CysLT1 distribution 
varied in murine and human lung cancer cell lines. Furthermore, montelukast 
suppressed CysLT1 expression in lung cancer cells. The treated cells also showed 
weaker migration ability compared with control cells. Knockout of CysLT1 using 
CRISPR/Cas9 editing in A549 cells further impaired the cell migration ability.
CONCLUSION: Montelukast inhibits the migration of lung cancer cells by 
suppressing CysLT1 expression, demonstrating the potential of using CysLT1 as a 
therapeutic target in lung cancer.

Auranofin is a thioredoxin reductase-1 inhibitor originally approved for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, auranofin has been repurposed as an 
anticancer drug, with pharmacological activity reported in multiple cancer 
types. In this study, we characterized transcriptional and genetic alterations 
associated with auranofin response in cancer. By integrating data from an 
auranofin cytotoxicity screen with transcriptome profiling of lung cancer cell 
lines, we identified an auranofin resistance signature comprising 29 genes, most 
of which are classical targets of the transcription factor NRF2, such as genes 
involved in glutathione metabolism (GCLC, GSR, SLC7A11) and thioredoxin system 
(TXN, TXNRD1). Pan-cancer analysis revealed that mutations in NRF2 pathway 
genes, namely KEAP1 and NFE2L2, are strongly associated with overexpression of 
the auranofin resistance gene set. By clustering cancer types based on auranofin 
resistance signature expression, hepatocellular carcinoma, and a subset of 
non-small cell lung cancer, head-neck squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal 
cancer carrying NFE2L2/KEAP1 mutations were predicted resistant, whereas 
leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma were predicted sensitive to auranofin. 
Cell viability assays in a panel of 20 cancer cell lines confirmed the augmented 
sensitivity of hematological cancers to auranofin; an effect associated with 
dependence upon glutathione and decreased expression of NRF2 target genes 
involved in GSH synthesis and recycling (GCLC, GCLM and GSR) in these cancer 
types. In summary, the omics-based identification of sensitive/resistant cancers 
and genetic alterations associated with these phenotypes may guide an 
appropriate repurposing of auranofin in cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Drug repositioning is a very important task that provides critical 
information for exploring the potential efficacy of drugs. Yet developing 
computational models that can effectively predict drug-disease associations 
(DDAs) is still a challenging task. Previous studies suggest that the accuracy 
of DDA prediction can be improved by integrating different types of biological 
features. But how to conduct an effective integration remains a challenging 
problem for accurately discovering new indications for approved drugs.
METHODS: In this paper, we propose a novel meta-path based graph representation 
learning model, namely RLFDDA, to predict potential DDAs on heterogeneous 
biological networks. RLFDDA first calculates drug-drug similarities and 
disease-disease similarities as the intrinsic biological features of drugs and 
diseases. A heterogeneous network is then constructed by integrating DDAs, 
disease-protein associations and drug-protein associations. With such a network, 
RLFDDA adopts a meta-path random walk model to learn the latent representations 
of drugs and diseases, which are concatenated to construct joint representations 
of drug-disease associations. As the last step, we employ the random forest 
classifier to predict potential DDAs with their joint representations.
RESULTS: To demonstrate the effectiveness of RLFDDA, we have conducted a series 
of experiments on two benchmark datasets by following a ten-fold 
cross-validation scheme. The results show that RLFDDA yields the best 
performance in terms of AUC and F1-score when compared with several 
state-of-the-art DDAs prediction models. We have also conducted a case study on 
two common diseases, i.e., paclitaxel and lung tumors, and found that 7 out of 
top-10 diseases and 8 out of top-10 drugs have already been validated for 
paclitaxel and lung tumors respectively with literature evidence. Hence, the 
promising performance of RLFDDA may provide a new perspective for novel DDAs 
discovery over heterogeneous networks.

OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer with distant metastases is associated with a very poor 
prognosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to cancer 
metastasis. Therefore, elucidation and inhibition of EMT signaling in lung 
cancer may be a new therapeutic strategy for improving the prognosis of 
patients. We constructed a high-throughput screening system for EMT inhibitors. 
Using this system, we aimed to identify compounds that indeed inhibit EMT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We generated a luciferase reporter cell line using A549 
human lung cancer cells and E-cadherin or vimentin as EMT markers. EMT was 
induced by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and candidate EMT inhibitors 
were screened from a library of 2,350 compounds. The selected compounds were 
further tested using secondary assays to verify the inhibition of EMT and 
invasive capacity of cells.
RESULTS: Values obtained by the assay were adjusted for the number of viable 
cells and scored by determining the difference between mean values of the 
positive and negative control groups. Four compounds were identified as novel 
candidate drugs. Among those, one (avagacestat) and two compounds (GDC-0879 and 
levothyroxine) improved the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin, respectively, 
in epithelial cells. GDC-0879 and levothyroxine also significantly inhibited the 
invasive capacity of cells.
CONCLUSION: We systematically screened approved, investigational, and druggable 
compounds with inhibitory effects using a reporter assay, and identified 
candidate drugs for EMT inhibition.

Prostate and lung cancers are among the most common cancer types, and they still 
need more therapeutics. For this purpose, saquinavir (SAQ) was tested alone and 
in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). PC-3 and A549 cells were exposed to 
increasing concentrations of both drugs alone or in combination, with 
simultaneous or sequential administration. Cell viability was obtained using the 
MTT assay and synergism values using CompuSyn software. Results showed that SAQ 
was the more cytotoxic of both drugs in PC-3 cells, while 5-FU was the most 
cytotoxic in A549 cells. When these drugs were used in combination, the more 
synergistic combination in PC-3 cells was the IC50 of SAQ with various 
concentrations of 5-FU, particularly when 5-FU was only applied 24 h later. 
Meanwhile for A549 the most promising combination was 5-FU with delayed SAQ, but 
with a weaker effect than all combinations demonstrated in PC-3 cells. These 
results demonstrate that SAQ could be used as a new repurposed drug for the 
treatment of prostate cancer and this treatment potential could be even greater 
if SAQ is combined with the anticancer drug 5-FU, while for lung cancer it is 
not as efficient and, therefore, not of as much interest.

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a rare complication of non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) with highly mortality. LM will occur once tumor cells spread to 
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space. Patients may suffer blindness, paralysis, 
and mental disorders that seriously affect their quality of life. There is a 
clear unmet need to improve the efficacy of diagnosis and treatment of LM. To 
better solve this problem, it is helpful to clarify the potential mechanisms of 
LM. Clinical manifestations, magnetic resonance imaging, and CSF biopsy are the 
key components in the diagnosis of NSCLC with LM. CSF cytology is insufficient 
and should be combined with liquid biology. The application of radiotherapy, 
intrathecal treatment, targeted therapy and immunotherapy provides more options 
for LM patients. Each treatment has a particular level of efficacy and can be 
used alone or in combination for individual patients. New technologies in 
radiotherapy, drug repositioning in intrathecal treatment, and the higher CSF 
permeability in TKIs have brought new breakthroughs in the treatment of LM. This 
review focused on clarifying the potential mechanisms, discussing the major 
clinical challenges, and summarizing recent advances in the diagnosis and 
treatment of LM from NSCLC. Future research is essential to improve the 
efficiency of diagnosis, to optimize therapy and to enhance patient prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The abnormal modification of chondroitin sulfate is one of the 
leading causes of disease, including cancer progression. During chondroitin 
sulfate biosynthesis, the CHST11 enzyme plays a vital role in its modification, 
but its role in cancer is not fully understood. Therefore, understanding the 
relationship between CHST11 and pulmonary-related diseases through clinically 
relevant information may be useful for diagnosis or treatment.
METHODS: A variety of pulmonary fibrosis clinical gene expression omnibus (GEO) 
datasets were used to assess the association between CHST11-related 
manifestations and fibrosis. Multiple lung cancer-related databases, including 
The Cancer Genome Atlas, GEO datasets, UCSC Xena, GEPIA2, Cbioportal and 
ingenuity pathway analysis were used to evaluate the clinical correlation 
between CHST11 and lung cancer and potential molecular mechanisms. For drug 
repurposing prediction, the molecules that correlated with CHST11 were subjected 
to the LINCS L1000 algorithm. A variety of in vitro assays were performed to 
evaluate the in-silico models, including RNA and protein expression, 
proliferation, migration and invasion.
RESULTS: Clinical analyses indicate that the levels of CHST11 are significantly 
elevated in cases of pulmonary-related diseases, including fibrosis and lung 
cancer. According to multiple lung cancer cohorts, CHST11 is the only member of 
the carbohydrate sulfotransferase family associated with overall survival for 
lung adenocarcinomas, and it is highly related to smoking-induced lung cancer 
patients. Based on the results of in vitro experiments, CHST11 expression 
contributes to tumor malignancy and promotes multiple fibrotic activators. 
Correlation-based ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that CHST11-related 
molecules contributed to pulmonary fibrosis or lung adenocarcinomas via similar 
upstream stimulators. Based on known molecular regulatory relationships, CHST11 
has been associated with the regulation of TGF-β and INFγ as important molecules 
contributing to fibrosis and cancer progression. Interestingly, WordCloud 
analysis revealed that CHST11-related molecules are involved in regulation 
primarily by integrin signaling, and these relationships were consistently 
reflected in the analysis of cell lines and the clinical correlation. A CHST11 
signature-based drug repurposing analysis demonstrated that the CHST11/integrin 
axis could be targeted by AG-1478 (Tyrphostin AG 1478), brefeldin A, 
geldanamycin and importazole.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first demonstration that CHST11 may be used 
as a biomarker for pulmonary fibrosis or lung cancer, and the levels of CHST11 
were increased by TGF-β and INFγ. The molecular simulation analyses demonstrate 
that the CHST11/integrin axis is a potential therapeutic target for treating 
lung cancer.

Cancer.

Translational Cancer Research Center (BTCRC), Nicosia 1516, Cyprus.

Despite the significant progress made towards comprehending the deregulated 
signatures in lung cancer, these vary from study to study. We reanalyzed 25 
studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to detect and annotate 
co-deregulated signatures in lung cancer and in single-gene or single-drug 
perturbation experiments. We aimed to decipher the networks that these 
co-deregulated genes (co-DEGs) form along with their upstream regulators. 
Differential expression and upstream regulators were computed using 
Characteristic Direction and Systems Biology tools, including GEO2Enrichr and 
X2K. Co-deregulated gene expression profiles were further validated across 
different molecular and immune subtypes in lung adenocarcinoma (TCGA-LUAD) and 
lung adenocarcinoma (TCGA-LUSC) datasets, as well as using immunohistochemistry 
data from the Human Protein Atlas, before being subjected to subsequent GO and 
KEGG enrichment analysis. The functional alterations of the co-upregulated genes 
in lung cancer were mostly related to immune response regulating the cell 
surface signaling pathway, in contrast to the co-downregulated genes, which were 
related to S-nitrosylation. Networks of hub proteins across the co-DEGs 
consisted of overlapping TFs (SOX2, MYC, KAT2A) and kinases (MAPK14, CSNK2A1 and 
CDKs). Furthermore, using Connectivity Map we highlighted putative repurposing 
drugs, including valproic acid, betonicine and astemizole. Similarly, we 
analyzed the co-DEG signatures in single-gene and single-drug perturbation 
experiments in lung cancer cell lines. In summary, we identified critical 
co-DEGs in lung cancer providing an innovative framework for their potential use 
in developing personalized therapeutic strategies.

Most lung cancer instances are non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). As stated by 
recent literature, cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) is upregulated in lung 
adenocarcinomas. COX-2 relates to enhanced cell proliferation and reduced 
apoptosis; both of which are essential for an invasive tumor growth and 
metastasis. Thus, COX-2 inhibition forms an important checkpoint. Drug 
repurposing and nano drug delivery systems will enable the faster and more 
efficacious drug development. This study was designed to prepare, characterize, 
and establish superior effectiveness of indomethacin (IND), (a nonselective 
COX-2 inhibitor) as liposomes (IND-Lip). IND-Lip were made using thin film 
hydration method and physicochemical properties were characterized. Cell 
viability was performed on NSCLC cell lines (A549, H1299 and H460) Clonogenic, 
spheroidal, caspase and COX-2 assays were then carried out. IND-Lip were found 
to have optimum physicochemical properties. Based on IC50 value of 
38.4 ± 4.9 µM, A549 cells were used for further assays. From clonogenic assay, % 
colonies were found to be 25.5 ± 9.5% at 200 µM of IND-Lip. IND-Lip performed 
significantly better in ex-vivo tumor reduction in 3D spheroid assay at 200 μM 
concentration, compared to plain IND by Day 15. Finally, a significant 
inhibition of COX-2 as well as induction of caspase in all IND treated groups 
was observed. It is of note that liposomes demonstrated a superior efficacy in 
all studies compared to the plain drug. IND through liposomal delivery system 
can be a potentially beneficial strategy for lung carcinoma. However, further 
clinical studies and in-vivo research are essential to comprehend the complete 
view of this approach.

Radioresistance towards radiation therapy has generated the need for the 
development of radiosensitizers as a potential drug. KRAS mutation brings 
radioresistance in tumor cells. The present work proves sensitization of cancer 
cells towards radiotherapy through inhibition of KRAS activation. Acquiring a 
drug repurposing approach, the in-silico screening revealed that pixantrone, an 
antineoplastic drug, possesses a high affinity towards KRAS G12C and G12D 
subtypes. The SPR study suggests that maximum affinity of pixantrone was 
observed with KRAS G12C>WT>G12D and G12S. Pixantrone potentially inhibited the 
KRAS activation in stable transfectants G12C and G12D cell lines and 
radiosensitized distinct KRAS mutant subtype cells. The combination of 
pixantrone with radiation causes enhanced dsDNA breaks along with enhanced ATM 
expression, and increased late apoptosis. The preclinical studies on NCr-fox1nu 
xenograft mice showed potent inhibition of tumor progression and prolonged 
survival of mcie due to the radiosensitizing effect of pixantrone. 
Radiation-induced activation of key effector proteins of RAS downstream 
pathways, like MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, were downregulated in tumor 
cells upon combination treatment. Interestingly, a robust upregulation of 
senescence marker p21 was observed in the tumor cells in combination treatment. 
These findings reveal a convergence between KRAS signaling, pixantrone 
treatment, and radiation conferring tumor cell death.

AIMS: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare cancer of lungs' pleural 
cavity, with minimally effective therapies available. Thus, there exists a 
necessity for drug repurposing which is an attractive strategy for drug 
development in MPM. Repurposing of an old FDA-approved anti-leprotic drug, 
Clofazimine (CFZ), presents an outstanding opportunity to explore its efficacy 
in treating MPM.
MAIN METHODS: Cytotoxicity, scratch assay, and clonogenic assays were employed 
to determine CFZ's ability to inhibit cell viability, cell migration, and colony 
growth. 3D Spheroid cell culture studies were performed to identify tumor growth 
inhibition potential of CFZ in MSTO-211H cell line. Gene expression analysis was 
performed using RT-qPCR assays to determine the CFZ's effect of key genes. 
Western blot studies were performed to determine CFZ's ability to induce 
apoptosis its effect to induce autophagy marker.
KEY FINDINGS: CFZ showed significant cytotoxicity against both immortalized and 
primary patient-derived cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 3.4 μM 
(MSTO-211H) to 7.1 μM (HAY). CFZ significantly impaired MPM cell cloning 
efficiency, migration, and tumor spheroid formation. 3D Spheroid model showed 
that CFZ resulted in reduction in spheroid volume. RT-qPCR data showed 
downregulation of genes β-catenin, BCL-9, and PRDX1; and upregulation of 
apoptosis markers such as PARP, Cleaved caspase 3, and AXIN2. Additionally, 
immunoblot analysis showed that CFZ down-regulates the expression of β-catenin 
(apoptosis induction) and up-regulates p62, LC3B protein II (autophagy 
inhibition).
SIGNIFICANCE: It can be concluded that CFZ could be a promising molecule to 
repurpose for MPM treatment which needs numerous efforts from further studies.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major component of the tumor 
microenvironment that mediate resistance of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. 
Tranilast is an antiallergic drug that suppresses the release of cytokines from 
various inflammatory cells. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect 
of tranilast on the interactions between non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
cells and the CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Three EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell 
lines, two KRAS-mutant cell lines, and three CAFs derived from NSCLC patients 
were used. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, the NSCLC cells were cocultured 
with the CAFs in vitro, and the molecular profiles and sensitivity to molecular 
targeted therapy were assessed. Crosstalk between NSCLC cells and CAFs induced 
multiple biological effects on the NSCLC cells both in vivo and in vitro, 
including activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, promotion of xenograft 
tumor growth, induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and 
acquisition of resistance to molecular-targeted therapy, including EGFR-mutant 
NSCLC cells to osimertinib and of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells to selumetinib. 
Treatment with tranilast led to inhibition of IL-6 secretion from the CAFs, 
which, in turn, resulted in inhibition of CAF-induced phospho-STAT3 
upregulation. Tranilast also inhibited CAF-induced EMT in the NSCLC cells. 
Finally, combined administration of tranilast with molecular-targeted therapy 
reversed the CAF-mediated resistance of the NSCLC cells to the 
molecular-targeted drugs, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that 
combined administration of tranilast with molecular-targeted therapy is a 
possible new treatment strategy to overcome drug resistance caused by cancer-CAF 
interaction.

NIMA-related kinase7 (NEK7) plays a multifunctional role in cell division and 
NLRP3 inflammasone activation. A typical expression or any mutation in the 
genetic makeup of NEK7 leads to the development of cancer malignancies and fatal 
inflammatory disease, i.e., breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gout, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and liver cirrhosis. Therefore, NEK7 is a promising target 
for drug development against various cancer malignancies. The combination of 
drug repurposing and structure-based virtual screening of large libraries of 
compounds has dramatically improved the development of anticancer drugs. The 
current study focused on the virtual screening of 1200 benzene sulphonamide 
derivatives retrieved from the PubChem database by selecting and docking 
validation of the crystal structure of NEK7 protein (PDB ID: 2WQN). The 
compounds library was subjected to virtual screening using Auto Dock Vina. The 
binding energies of screened compounds were compared to standard Dabrafenib. In 
particular, compound 762 exhibited excellent binding energy of -42.67 kJ/mol, 
better than Dabrafenib (-33.89 kJ/mol). Selected drug candidates showed a 
reactive profile that was comparable to standard Dabrafenib. To characterize the 
stability of protein-ligand complexes, molecular dynamic simulations were 
performed, providing insight into the molecular interactions. The 
NEK7-Dabrafenib complex showed stability throughout the simulated trajectory. In 
addition, binding affinities, pIC50, and ADMET profiles of drug candidates were 
predicted using deep learning models. Deep learning models predicted the binding 
affinity of compound 762 best among all derivatives, which supports the findings 
of virtual screening. These findings suggest that top hits can serve as 
potential inhibitors of NEK7. Moreover, it is recommended to explore the 
inhibitory potential of identified hits compounds through in-vitro and in-vivo 
approaches.

Despite the recent development of precision medicine and targeted therapies, 
lung cancer remains the top cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The 
patients diagnosed with metastatic disease have a five-year survival rate lower 
than 6%. In metastatic disease, EGFR is the most common driver of mutation, with 
the most common co-driver hitting TP53. EGFR-positive patients are offered the 
frontline treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, yet the development of 
resistance and the lack of alternative therapies make this group of patients 
only fit for clinical trial participation. Since mutant p53 is the most common 
co-driver in the metastatic setting, therapies reactivating the p53 pathway 
might serve as a promising alternative therapeutic approach in patients who have 
developed a resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This review focuses on the 
molecular background of EGFR-mutated lung cancer and discusses novel therapeutic 
options converging on the reactivation of p53 tumor suppressor pathways.

Human epidermal growth factor receptors HER1 and HER2, overexpressed in 
non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, are key regulators 
of tumor cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Many antibody- or 
peptide-based fluorescent probes targeted to HER1/HER2 are under active clinical 
evaluation. However, the effective small-molecule near-infrared (NIR) 
fluorescent probes are still lacking. Herein, with the strategy of drug 
repurposing, we developed a series of HER1/HER2-targeted probes YQ-H (01-07) 
composed of fluorophore (a cyanine dye, MPA), linker unit and targeted unit 
(lapatinib, LAP). The synthesized probes were evaluated in vitro and in vivo 
tumor specificity/affinity. Specially, the probe YQ-H-06 exhibited optimal 
pharmacokinetic property and tumor/normal tissue ratio (T/N) in tumor-bearing 
mice. Furthermore, we evaluated the targeting capability of YQ-H-06 in 
orthotopic colorectal cancer and orthotopic hepatic carcinoma mice. It was 
indicated that YQ-H-06 had the characteristic of great biosafety, favorable pH 
and chemical stability, as well as provided excellent tumor contrast in 
orthotopic murine tumor models. The NIR fluorescent probe YQ-H-06 will shed 
light on tumor detection and fluorescence-guided surgery.

Canakinumab is an anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody approved for use in a 
range of immune-related disorders. During the clinical investigation (CANTOS 
trial) for prevention of cardiovascular complications, therapy was linked to a 
reduction in both the occurrence and mortality of lung cancer. This unexpected 
observation fuelled the rapid initiation of four large clinical trials to 
evaluate potential anticancer efficacy (in combination with chemotherapy and/or 
immunotherapy), before fully validating these observations in a dedicated study. 
The first two trials (CANOPY-1 and 2) have now been reported and have both have 
failed to meet their primary efficacy endpoints. In this article, we explore the 
scientific and clinical rationale behind the development of canakinumab in 
oncology, the repurposing approach utilised and implications this may have for 
the wider drug repurposing field in the development of new cancer medicines.

INTRODUCTION: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy 
affecting the mesothelial cells in the pleural lining surrounding the lungs. 
First approved chemotherapy against MPM was a platinum/antifolate 
(cisplatin/pemetrexed) (2003). Since then, no USFDA approvals have gone through 
for small molecules as these molecules have not been proven to be 
therapeutically able in later stages of clinical studies. An alternative to 
conventional chemotherapy can be utilization of monoclonal antibodies, which are 
proven to improve patient survival significantly as compared to conventional 
chemotherapy (Nivolumab + Ipilimumab, 2020).
AREA COVERED: Drug repurposing has been instrumental in drug discovery for rare 
diseases such as MPM and multiple repositioned small molecule therapies and 
immunotherapies are currently being tested for its applicability in MPM 
management. This article summarizes essential breakthroughs along the 
pre-clinical and clinical developmental stages of small molecules and monoclonal 
antibodies for MPM management.
EXPERT OPINION: For rare diseases such as malignant pleural mesothelioma, a drug 
repurposing strategy can be adapted as it eases the financial burden on 
pharmaceutical companies along with fast-tracking development. With the rise of 
multiple small molecule repurposed therapies and innovations in localized 
treatment, MPM therapeutics are bound to be more effective in this decade.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises the majority (~85%) of 
all lung tumors, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma 
(LUSC) being the most frequently diagnosed histological subtypes. Multi-modal 
omics profiling has been carried out in NSCLC, but no studies have yet reported 
a unique metabolite-related gene signature and altered metabolic pathways 
associated with LUAD and LUSC.
METHODS: We integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics to analyze 30 human lung 
tumors and adjacent noncancerous tissues. Differential co-expression was used to 
identify modules of metabolites that were altered between normal and tumor.
RESULTS: We identified unique metabolite-related gene signatures specific for 
LUAD and LUSC and key pathways aberrantly regulated at both transcriptional and 
metabolic levels. Differential co-expression analysis revealed that loss of 
coherence between metabolites in tumors is a major characteristic in both LUAD 
and LUSC. We identified one metabolic onco-module gained in LUAD, characterized 
by nine metabolites and 57 metabolic genes. Multi-omics integrative analysis 
revealed a 28 metabolic gene signature associated with poor survival in LUAD, 
with six metabolite-related genes as individual prognostic markers.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the clinical utility of this integrated metabolic 
gene signature in LUAD by using it to guide repurposing of AZD-6482, a PI3Kβ 
inhibitor which significantly inhibited three genes from the 28-gene signature. 
Overall, we have integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses to show 
that LUAD and LUSC have distinct profiles, inferred gene signatures with 
prognostic value for patient survival, and identified therapeutic targets and 
repurposed drugs for potential use in NSCLC treatment.

Lung cancer is the most common cancer in men and women. This cancer is divided 
into two main types, namely non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell 
lung cancer (SCLC). Around 85 to 90 percent of lung cancers are 
NSCLC. Repositioning potent candidate drugs in NSCLC treatment is one of the 
important topics in cancer studies. Drug repositioning (DR) or drug repurposing 
is a method for identifying new therapeutic uses of existing drugs. The current 
study applies a computational drug repositioning method to identify candidate 
drugs to treat NSCLC patients. To this end, at first, the transcriptomics 
profile of NSCLC and healthy (control) samples was obtained from the GEO 
database with the accession number GSE21933. Then, the gene co-expression 
network was reconstructed for NSCLC samples using the WGCNA, and two significant 
purple and magenta gene modules were extracted. Next, a list of transcription 
factor genes that regulate purple and magenta modules' genes was extracted from 
the TRRUST V2.0 online database, and the TF-TG (transcription factors-target 
genes) network was drawn. Afterward, a list of drugs targeting TF-TG genes was 
obtained from the DGIdb V4.0 database, and two drug-gene interaction networks, 
including drug-TG and drug-TF, were drawn. After analyzing gene co-expression 
TF-TG, and drug-gene interaction networks, 16 drugs were selected as potent 
candidates for NSCLC treatment. Out of 16 selected drugs, nine drugs, namely 
Methotrexate, Olanzapine, Haloperidol, Fluorouracil, Nifedipine, Paclitaxel, 
Verapamil, Dexamethasone, and Docetaxel, were chosen from the drug-TG 
sub-network. In addition, nine drugs, including Cisplatin, Daunorubicin, 
Dexamethasone, Methotrexate, Hydrocortisone, Doxorubicin, Azacitidine, 
Vorinostat, and Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, were selected from the drug-TF 
sub-network. Methotrexate and Dexamethasone are common in drug-TG and drug-TF 
sub-networks. In conclusion, this study proposed 16 drugs as potent candidates 
for NSCLC treatment through analyzing gene co-expression, TF-TG, and drug-gene 
interaction networks.

BACKGROUND: Capmatinib (CAP) is a drug that has been used to treat non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults. Presently, its novel effects on skeletal 
muscle insulin signaling, inflammation, and lipogenesis in adipocytes have been 
uncovered with a perspective of drug repositioning. However, the impact of CAP 
on LPS-mediated interaction between human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs) and THP-1 monocytes has yet to be investigated.
METHODS: HUVECs and THP-1 monocytes were treated with LPS and CAP. The protein 
expression levels were determined using Western blotting. Target protein 
knockdown was conducted using small interfering (si) RNA transfection. 
Interactions between HUVECs and THP-1 cells were assayed using green fluorescent 
dye.
RESULTS: This study found that CAP treatment ameliorated cell adhesion between 
THP-1 monocytes and HUVECs and the expression of adhesive molecules, such as 
intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 
(VCAM-1), and E-selectin. Moreover, phosphorylation of inflammatory markers, 
such as NFκB and IκB as well as TNFα and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 
(MCP-1) released from HUVECs and THP-1 monocytes, was prevented by CAP 
treatment. Treatment with CAP augmented PPARδ and IL-10 expression. 
siRNA-associated suppression of PPARδ and IL-10 abolished the effects of CAP on 
cell interaction between HUVECs and THP-1 cells and inflammatory responses. 
Further, PPARδ siRNA mitigated CAP-mediated induction of IL-10 expression.
CONCLUSION: These findings imply that CAP improves inflamed endothelial-monocyte 
adhesion via a PPARδ/IL-10-dependent pathway. The current study provides 
in vitro evidence for a therapeutic approach for treating atherosclerosis.

Pirfenidone, an antifibrotic drug, has antitumor potential against different 
types of cancers. Our work explored whether pirfenidone sensitizes non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to chemotherapeutic treatments. The 
cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel in combination with pirfenidone against three 
NSCLC cell lines (A549, NCI-H322 and NCI-H460) was evaluated using the 
sulforhodamine B assay. The effects of this combination on cell viability 
(trypan blue exclusion assay), proliferation (BrdU incorporation assay), cell 
cycle (flow cytometry following PI staining) and cell death (Annexin V-FITC 
detection assay and Western blot) were analyzed on the most sensitive cell line 
(NCI-H460). The cytotoxic effect of this drug combination was also evaluated 
against two non-tumorigenic cell lines (MCF-10A and MCF-12A). Finally, the 
ability of pirfenidone to sensitize NCI-H460 cells to a combination of 
paclitaxel plus carboplatin was assessed. The results demonstrated that 
pirfenidone sensitized NCI-H460 cells to paclitaxel treatment, reducing cell 
growth, viability and proliferation, inducing alterations in the cell cycle 
profile and causing an increase in the % of cell death. Remarkably, this 
combination did not increase cytotoxicity in non-tumorigenic cells. Importantly, 
pirfenidone also sensitized NCI-H460 cells to paclitaxel plus carboplatin. This 
work highlights the possibility of repurposing pirfenidone in combination with 
chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC.

Cancer care has become a challenge with the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario. 
Specially, cancers like small cell lung cancers (SCLC) are difficult to treat 
even in the normal situation due to their rapid growth and early metastasis. For 
such patients, treatment can't be compromised and care must be taken to ensure 
their minimum exposure to the ongoing spread of COVID-19 infection. For this 
reason, in-house treatments are being suggested for these patients. Another 
issue is that symptoms of SCLC match well with that of COVID-19 infection. 
Hence, the detection of COVID-19 may also get delayed leading to unnecessary 
complications. Thus, we have tried to investigate if the therapeutics that is 
currently used in lung cancer treatment can also act against SARS-CoV-2. If it 
is so, the same treatment protocols can be continued even if the SCLC patient 
had contracted COVID-19 without compromising the cancer care. For this, RNA 
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) from SARS-CoV-2 has been selected as drug 
target. Both docking and molecular dynamicssimulation analysis have indicated 
that Paclitaxel and Dacomitinib may be explored as multi-target drugs for both 
SCLC and COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Lung cancer (LC) is one of the leading causes of mortality accounting for almost 
25% of cancer deaths throughout the world. The shortfall of affordable and 
effective first-line chemotherapeutics, the existence of resistant tumors, and 
the non-optimal route of administration contribute to poor prognosis and high 
mortality in LC. Administration of repurposed non-oncology drugs (RNODs) loaded 
in nanocarriers (NCs) via inhalation may prove as an effective alternative 
strategy to treat LC. Furthermore, their site-specific release through 
inhalation route using an appropriate inhalation device would offer improved 
therapeutic efficacy, thereby reducing mortality and improving patients' quality 
of life. The current manuscript offers a comprehensive overview on use of RNODs 
in LC treatment with an emphasis on their inhalation delivery and the associated 
challenges. The role of NCs to improve lung deposition and targeting of RNODs 
via inhalation are also elaborated. In addition, information about various RNODs 
in clinical trials for the treatment of LC, possibility for repurposing 
phytoceuticals against LC via inhalation and the bottlenecks associated with 
repurposing RNODs against cancer are also highlighted. Based on the reported 
studies covered in this manuscript, it was understood that delivery of RNODs via 
inhalation has emerged as a propitious approach. Hence, it is anticipated to 
provide effective first-line treatment at an affordable cost in debilitating LC 
from low and middle-income countries (LMIC).

Human Recombinant DNase I (Pulmozyme(®)) Inhibits Lung Metastases in Murine

Tumor-associated cell-free DNAs (cfDNA) play an important role in the promotion 
of metastases. Previous studies proved the high antimetastatic potential of 
bovine pancreatic DNase I and identified short interspersed nuclear elements 
(SINEs) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs)and fragments of oncogenes 
in cfDNA as the main molecular targets of enzyme in the bloodstream. Here, 
recombinant human DNase I (commercial name Pulmozyme®), which is used for the 
treatment of cystic fibrosis in humans, was repurposed for the inhibition of 
lung metastases in the B16 melanoma model in mice. We found that Pulmozyme® 
strongly reduced migration and induced apoptosis of B16 cells in vitro and 
effectively inhibited metastases in lungs and liver in vivo. Pulmozyme® was 
shown to be two times more effective when administered intranasally (i.n.) than 
bovine DNase I, but intramuscular (i.m.) administration forced it to exhibit as 
high an antimetastatic activity as bovine DNase I. Both DNases administered to 
mice either i.m. or i.n. enhanced the DNase activity of blood serum to the level 
of healthy animals, significantly decreased cfDNA concentrations, efficiently 
degraded SINE and LINE repeats and c-Myc fragments in the bloodstream and 
induced apoptosis and disintegration of neutrophil extracellular traps in 
metastatic foci; as a result, this manifested as the inhibition of metastases 
spread. Thus, Pulmozyme®, which is already an approved drug, can be recommended 
for use in the treatment of lung metastases.

BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are potent antimicrobials with multiple 
effects on host cells and tissues. Although FQs can attenuate cancer invasion 
and metastasis, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has functional roles in tumor angiogenesis, 
invasion, and metastasis, and is associated with cancer progression and poor 
prognosis, suggesting that inhibitors of MMP-9 activity and transcription are 
prime candidates for cancer therapy. Despite numerous preclinical data 
supporting the use of MMP-9 inhibitors as anticancer drugs, the few available 
examples are not therapeutically useful due to low specificity and off-target 
effects. We examined the effects of FQs on MMP-9 production in cancer cells 
following transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and phorbol 12-myristate 
13-acetate (PMA) stimulation.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES: Using confluent cultures of HepG2 and A549 cells, the 
effects of FQs (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, and 
enrofloxacin) on TGF-β and PMA-induced MMP-9 mRNA expression and production were 
studied in RNA extracts and culture supernatants, respectively. FQs specifically 
abrogated TGF-β and PMA-induced MMP-9 levels and activity in a concentration and 
time-dependent manner, without affecting other MMPs or proteins involved in 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Additionally, FQs inhibited TGF-β and 
PMA-induced cell migration via p38 and cyclic AMP signaling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Overall, we demonstrated that FQs inhibit cancer 
cell migration and invasion by downregulating MMP-9 expression and revealed the 
cellular mechanisms underlying their potential value in cancer treatment.

An early event in lung oncogenesis is loss of the tumour suppressor gene LIMD1 
(LIM domains containing 1); this encodes a scaffold protein, which suppresses 
tumorigenesis via a number of different mechanisms. Approximately 45% of 
non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are deficient in LIMD1, yet this subtype of 
NSCLC has been overlooked in preclinical and clinical investigations. Defining 
therapeutic targets in these LIMD1 loss-of-function patients is difficult due to 
a lack of 'druggable' targets, thus alternative approaches are required. To this 
end, we performed the first drug repurposing screen to identify compounds that 
confer synthetic lethality with LIMD1 loss in NSCLC cells. PF-477736 was shown 
to selectively target LIMD1-deficient cells in vitro through inhibition of 
multiple kinases, inducing cell death via apoptosis. Furthermore, PF-477736 was 
effective in treating LIMD1-/- tumours in subcutaneous xenograft models, with no 
significant effect in LIMD1+/+ cells. We have identified a novel drug tool with 
significant preclinical characterisation that serves as an excellent candidate 
to explore and define LIMD1-deficient cancers as a new therapeutic subgroup of 
critical unmet need.

INTRODUCTION: Mutations in BRAF occur in 2% to 4% of patients with lung 
adenocarcinoma. Combination dabrafenib and trametinib, or single-agent 
vemurafenib is approved only for patients with cancers driven by the V600E BRAF 
mutation. Targeted therapy is not currently available for patients harboring 
non-V600 BRAF mutations.
METHODS: A lung adenocarcinoma patient-derived xenograft model (PHLC12) with 
wild-type and nonamplified EGFR was tested for response to EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs). A cell line derived from this model (X12CL) was also used to 
evaluate drug sensitivity and to identify potential drivers by small interfering 
RNA knockdown. Kinase assays were used to test direct targeting of the candidate 
driver by the EGFR TKIs. Structural modeling including, molecular dynamics 
simulations, and binding assays were conducted to explore the mechanism of 
off-target inhibition by EGFR TKIs on the model 12 driver.
RESULTS: Both patient-derived xenograft PHLC12 and the X12CL cell line were 
sensitive to multiple EGFR TKIs. The BRAFG469V mutation was found to be the only 
known oncogenic mutation in this model. Small interfering RNA knockdown of BRAF, 
but not the EGFR, killed X12CL, confirming BRAFG469V as the oncogenic driver. 
Kinase activity of the BRAF protein isolated from X12CL was inhibited by 
treatment with the EGFR TKIs gefitinib and osimertinib, and expression of 
BRAFG469V in non-EGFR-expressing NR6 cells promoted growth in low serum 
condition, which was also sensitive to EGFR TKIs. Structural modeling, molecular 
dynamic simulations, and in vitro binding assays support BRAFG469V being a 
direct target of the TKIs.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically approved EGFR TKIs can be repurposed to treat patients 
with non-small cell lung cancer harboring the BRAFG469V mutation.

The tumorous niche may drive the plasticity of heterogeneity and cancer 
stemness, leading to drug resistance and metastasis, which is the main reason of 
treatment failure in most cancer patients. The aim of this study was to 
establish a tumor microenvironment (TME)-based screening to identify drugs that 
can specifically target cancer stem cells (CSCs) and cancer-associated 
fibroblasts (CAFs) in the TME. Methods: Lung cancer patient-derived cancer cell 
and CAFs were utilized to mimic the TME and reproduce the stemness properties of 
CSCs in vitro and develop a high-throughput drug screening platform with 
phenotypical parameters. Limiting dilution assay, sphere-forming and ALDH 
activity assay were utilized to measure the cancer stemness characteristics. In 
vivo patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and single-cell RNA sequencing were 
used to evaluate the mechanisms of the compounds in CSCs and CAFs. Results: The 
TME-based drug screening platform could comprehensively evaluate the response of 
cancer cells, CSCs and CAFs to different treatments. Among the 1,524 compounds 
tested, several drugs were identified to have anti-CAFs, anticancer and 
anti-CSCs activities. Aloe-emodin and digoxin both show anticancer and anti-CSCs 
activity in vitro and in vivo, which was further confirmed in the lung cancer 
PDX model. The combination of digoxin and chemotherapy improved therapeutic 
efficacy. The single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed that digoxin could 
suppress the CSCs subpopulation in CAFs-cocultured cancer cells and cytokine 
production in CAFs. Conclusions: The TME-based drug screening platform provides 
a tool to identify and repurpose compounds targeting cancer cells, CSCs and 
CAFs, which may accelerate drug development and therapeutic application for lung 
cancer patients.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations typically occur in exons 18-21 
and are established driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)1-3. 
Targeted therapies are approved for patients with 'classical' mutations and a 
small number of other mutations4-6. However, effective therapies have not been 
identified for additional EGFR mutations. Furthermore, the frequency and effects 
of atypical EGFR mutations on drug sensitivity are unknown1,3,7-10. Here we 
characterize the mutational landscape in 16,715 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, 
and establish the structure-function relationship of EGFR mutations on drug 
sensitivity. We found that EGFR mutations can be separated into four distinct 
subgroups on the basis of sensitivity and structural changes that 
retrospectively predict patient outcomes following treatment with EGFR 
inhibitors better than traditional exon-based groups. Together, these data 
delineate a structure-based approach for defining functional groups of EGFR 
mutations that can effectively guide treatment and clinical trial choices for 
patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and suggest that a structure-function-based 
approach may improve the prediction of drug sensitivity to targeted therapies in 
oncogenes with diverse mutations.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(EGFR-TKIs) are key drugs in cancer treatment due to their minor adverse effects 
and outstanding anticancer effects. However, drugs for overcoming EGFR-TKI 
resistance are not in clinical use so far. Therefore, to overcome resistance, we 
focused on lurasidone, a new antipsychotic drug, due to its mild adverse effect 
profile from the viewpoint of drug repositioning.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored the effects of lurasidone alone or in 
combination with EGFR-TKI on the growth of osimertinib-resistant cancer cells 
the anti-apoptotic marker expression such as survivin, and autophagy levels by 
LC-3B expression.
RESULTS: Within a non-toxic concentration range in normal cells, lurasidone and 
osimertinib combination therapy showed a growth-inhibitory effect in 
osimertinib-resistant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, lurasidone 
decreased survivin expression and mildly induced autophagy.
CONCLUSION: Lurasidone may increase the sensitivity to osimertinib in 
osimertinib-resistant cancer cells in drug repurposing.

PURPOSE: Metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) is a crucial factor 
determining patient survival. Repurposing of the antipsychotic agent penfluridol 
has been found to be effective in the inhibition of growth of various cancers. 
As yet, however, the anti-metastatic effect of penfluridol on LADC has rarely 
been investigated. Herein, we addressed the therapeutic potential of penfluridol 
on the invasion/metastasis of LADC cells harboring different epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) mutation statuses.
METHODS: MTS viability, transwell migration and invasion, and tumor endothelium 
adhesion assays were employed to determine cytotoxic and anti-metastatic effects 
of penfluridol on LADC cells. Protease array, Western blot, immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and expression knockdown by shRNA or 
exogenous overexpression by DNA plasmid transfection were performed to explore 
the underlying mechanisms, both in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We found that nontoxic concentrations of penfluridol reduced the 
migration, invasion and adhesion of LADC cells. Protease array screening 
identified matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) as a potential target of 
penfluridol to modulate the motility and adhesion of LADC cells. In addition, we 
found that MMP-12 exhibited the most significantly adverse prognostic effect in 
LADC among 39 cancer types. Mechanistic investigations revealed that penfluridol 
inhibited the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)/uPA receptor/transforming 
growth factor-β/Akt axis to downregulate MMP-12 expression and, subsequently, 
reverse MMP-12-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Subsequent 
analysis of clinical LADC samples revealed a positive correlation between MMP12 
and mesenchymal-related gene expression levels. A lower survival rate was found 
in LADC patients with a SNAl1high/MMP12high profile compared to those with a 
SNAl1low/MMP12low profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that MMP-12 may serve as a useful biomarker 
for predicting LADC progression and as a promising penfluridol target for 
treating metastatic LADC.

BACKGROUND: Malignant Mesothelioma (MM), an orphan but aggressive malignancy of 
the mesothelial membrane, is a fatal tumour. Global epidemic related to 
malignant pleural mesothelioma is on the rise, so there is a need to explore 
novel biomarkers and ingenious therapeutic approaches to stalk this silent 
killer.
OBJECTIVE: The main aim of the present review is to provide a consolidated 
overview of the recent active patents related to diagnosis and therapy in the 
field of MM that will impact its future management.
METHODS: A search of existing literature was conducted from a PubMed database 
search. Recent patent information was fetched out from online free open-access 
databases. For related clinical trials, www.clinicaltrial.gov was searched.
RESULTS: Patent search data showed 72 active patents related to diagnosis and 
therapy in the field of MM, which we classified into eight broad categories. Of 
these, maximum 17 patents were attributed to immunotherapy and 13 were 
attributed to ""Drug Repositioning"" and ""Biological / synthetic"" based 
candidates. Relatively low number of patents accounts for gene signature (7), 
epigenetics (3) and microRNA (2) based diagnosis and therapy. Remaining 17 
patents were distributed amongst virotherapy and various miscellaneous 
categories. Furthermore, our clinical trial based investigation revealed the 
futuristic impact of listed patents in MM patient management.
CONCLUSION: This review article has provided an overview of patent based 
advancement in the field of MM, which might become apex in the clinical settings 
in future. Interestingly, immunotherapy and ""drug repositioning"" based therapy 
seems to be the front-runners in the race to provide relief.

Erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits epidermal growth factor 
receptor. It is being used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients 
(NSCLC). Repurposing noncancer drugs for cancer treatment is a current issue and 
it has many advantages. We planned to reveal the effects of noncancer drugs 
[calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and others] on erlotinib. We scanned the files 
of NSCLC patients retrospectively who were applied to Karadeniz Technical 
University between January 2013 and April 2019 and used erlotinib. There were 63 
patients, 9 of them were taking CCB simultaneously for arterial hypertension. We 
analyzed some parameters of these patients and their effects on overall survival 
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A χ2 or Fisher's exact test, 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox regressions were used in the statistical analysis. 12-month 
OS rates of CCB user and nonuser were 78.3 and 39.7%, respectively, [odds ratio 
(OR),0.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27-0.75; P = 0.023]. 24-month PFS 
rates of CCB user and nonuser were 44.4 and 8.3%, respectively (OR,0.11; 95% CI, 
0.02-0.60; P = 0.016). There was 12-month OS and 24-month PFS advantage with 
simultaneously taking CCBs and erlotinib, they have an additive effect for 
NSCLC. This study will be inspiring future prospective studies.

OPALS: A New Osimertinib Adjunctive Treatment of Lung Adenocarcinoma or 
Glioblastoma Using Five Repurposed Drugs.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacological targeting aberrant activation of epidermal growth 
factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is an established approach to treating 
lung adenocarcinoma. Osimertinib is a tyrosine kinase approved and effective in 
treating lung adenocarcinomas that have one of several common activating 
mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor. The emergence of resistance to 
osimertinib after a year or two is the rule. We developed a five-drug adjuvant 
regimen designed to increase osimertinib's growth inhibition and thereby delay 
the development of resistance. Areas of Uncertainty: Although the assembled 
preclinical data is strong, preclinical data and the following clinical trial 
results can be discrepant. The safety of OPALS drugs when used individually is 
excellent. We have no data from humans on their tolerability when used as an 
ensemble. That there is no data from the individual drugs to suspect problematic 
interaction does not exclude the possibility.
DATA SOURCES: All relevant PubMed.org articles on the OPALS drugs and 
corresponding pathophysiology of lung adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma were 
reviewed. Therapeutic Opinion: The five drugs of OPALS are in wide use in 
general medicine for non-oncology indications. OPALS uses the anti-protozoal 
drug pyrimethamine, the antihistamine cyproheptadine, the antibiotic 
azithromycin, the antihistamine loratadine, and the potassium sparing diuretic 
spironolactone. We show how these inexpensive and generically available drugs 
intersect with and inhibit lung adenocarcinoma growth drive. We also review data 
showing that both OPALS adjuvant drugs and osimertinib have data showing they 
may be active in suppressing glioblastoma growth.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive bone malignancy and the third most common 
cancer in adolescence. Since the late 1970s, OS therapy and prognosis had only 
modest improvements, making it appealing to explore new tools that could help 
ameliorate the treatment. We present a meta-analysis of the gene expression 
signature of primary OS, and propose small molecules that could reverse this 
signature. The meta-analysis was performed using GEO microarray series. We first 
compared gene expression from eleven primary OS against osteoblasts to obtain 
the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We later filtered those DEGs by 
verifying which ones had a concordant direction of differential expression in a 
validation group of 82 OS samples versus 30 bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells 
(BM-MSC) samples. A final gene expression signature of 266 genes (98 up and 168 
down regulated) was obtained. The L1000CDS2 engine was used for drug 
repurposing. The top molecules predicted to reverse the signature were afatinib 
(PubChem CID 10184653), BRD-K95196255 (PubChem CID 3242434), DG-041 (PubChem CID 
11296282) and CA-074 Me (PubChem CID 23760717). Afatinib (Gilotrif™) is 
currently used for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations, 
and in vitro evidence shows antineoplastic potential in OS cells. The other 
three molecules have reports of antineoplastic effects, but are not currently 
FDA-approved. Further studies are necessary to establish the potential of these 
drugs in OS treatment. We believe our results can be an important contribution 
for the investigation of new therapeutic genetic targets and for selecting new 
drugs to be tested for OS.

There is growing evidence that repurposed drugs demonstrate excellent efficacy 
against many cancers, while facilitating accelerated drug development process. 
In this study, bedaquiline (BDQ), an FDA approved anti-mycobacterial agent, was 
repurposed and an inhalable cyclodextrin complex formulation was developed to 
explore its anti-cancer activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A 
sulfobutyl ether derivative of β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD) was selected based on 
phase solubility studies and molecular modeling to prepare an inclusion complex 
of BDQ and cyclodextrin. Aqueous solubility of BDQ was increased by 2.8 × 
103-fold after complexation with SBE-β-CD, as compared to its intrinsic 
solubility. Solid-state characterization studies confirmed the successful 
incorporation of BDQ in the SBE-β-CD cavity. In vitro lung deposition study 
results demonstrated excellent inhalable properties (mass median aerodynamic 
diameter: 2.9 ± 0.6 µm (<5 µm) and fine particle fraction: 83.3 ± 3.8%) of 
BDQ-CD complex. Accelerated stability studies showed BDQ-CD complex to be stable 
up to 3 weeks. From cytotoxicity studies, a slight enhancement in the 
anti-cancer efficacy was observed with BDQ-cyclodextrin complex, compared to BDQ 
alone in H1299 cell line. The IC50 values for BDQ and BDQ-CD complex were found 
to be ~40 µM in case of H1299 cell line at 72 h, whereas BDQ/BDQ-CD were not 
found to be cytotoxic up to concentrations of 50 µM in A549 cell line. Taken 
together, BDQ-CD complex offers a promising inhalation strategy with efficient 
lung deposition and cytotoxicity for NSCLC treatment.

In the connectivity map (CMap) approach to drug repositioning and development, 
transcriptional signature of disease is constructed by differential gene 
expression analysis between the diseased tissue or cells and the control. The 
negative correlation between the transcriptional disease signature and the 
transcriptional signature of the drug, or a bioactive compound, is assumed to 
indicate its ability to ""reverse"" the disease process. A major limitation of 
traditional CMaP analysis is the use of signatures derived from bulk disease 
tissues. Since the key driver pathways are most likely dysregulated in only a 
subset of cells, the ""averaged"" transcriptional signatures resulting from bulk 
analysis lack the resolution to effectively identify effective therapeutic 
agents. The use of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) transcriptomic assay 
facilitates construction of disease signatures that are specific to individual 
cell types, but methods for using scRNA-seq data in the context of CMaP analysis 
are lacking. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes 
result in the activation of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). The mTORC1 inhibitor 
Sirolimus is the only FDA-approved drug to treat LAM. Novel therapies for LAM 
are urgently needed as the disease recurs with discontinuation of the treatment 
and some patients are insensitive to the drug. We developed methods for 
constructing disease transcriptional signatures and CMaP analysis using 
scRNA-seq profiling and applied them in the analysis of scRNA-seq data of lung 
tissue from naïve and sirolimus-treated LAM patients. New methods successfully 
implicated mTORC1 inhibitors, including Sirolimus, as capable of reverting the 
LAM transcriptional signatures. The CMaP analysis mimicking standard bulk-tissue 
approach failed to detect any connection between the LAM signature and mTORC1 
signaling. This indicates that the precise signature derived from scRNA-seq data 
using our methods is the crucial difference between the success and the failure 
to identify effective therapeutic treatments in CMaP analysis.

OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer is one of the most frequent types of cancers that lead 
to death. Sildenafil is a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-5 and showed 
potential anticancer effects, which has not yet been fully evaluated. Thus, this 
study aims to investigate the potential anticancer effect of sildenafil in 
urethane-induced lung cancer in BALB/c mice.
METHODS: Five-week-old male BALB/c mice were treated with either (i) normal 
saline only, (ii) sildenafil only 50 mg kg-1/ P.O every other day for the last 
four successive weeks, (iii) urethane 1.5 gm kg-1 i.p (at day 1 and day 60), 
(iv) carboplatin after urethane induction, or (v) sildenafil after urethane 
induction.
KEY FINDINGS: It was shown that sildenafil significantly increased the levels of 
cGMP and Caspase-3 with a reduction of NF-κB, Bcl-2, Cyclin D1, intercellular 
adhesion molecule 1, matrix metalloproteinase-2 levels and normalisation of Nrf2 
along with pronounced improvement in the histological patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that sildenafil markedly induces cell cycle 
arrest, apoptosis and inhibits the metastatic activity through activation of 
cyclic guanosine monophosphate/protein kinase G pathway and down-regulation of 
cyclin D1 and nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells 
with downstream anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, which underscores the critical 
importance of future using sildenafil in the treatment of lung cancer.

Growing evidence is showing that acetylation plays an essential role in cancer, 
but studies on the impact of KDAC inhibition (KDACi) on the metabolic profile 
are still in their infancy. Here, we analyzed, by using an iTRAQ-based 
quantitative proteomics approach, the changes in the proteome of KRAS-mutated 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells in response to trichostatin-A 
(TSA) and nicotinamide (NAM) under normoxia and hypoxia. Part of this response 
was further validated by molecular and biochemical analyses and correlated with 
the proliferation rates, apoptotic cell death, and activation of ROS scavenging 
mechanisms in opposition to the ROS production. Despite the differences among 
the KDAC inhibitors, up-regulation of glycolysis, TCA cycle, oxidative 
phosphorylation and fatty acid synthesis emerged as a common metabolic response 
underlying KDACi. We also observed that some of the KDACi effects at metabolic 
levels are enhanced under hypoxia. Furthermore, we used a drug repositioning 
machine learning approach to list candidate metabolic therapeutic agents for 
KRAS mutated NSCLC. Together, these results allow us to better understand the 
metabolic regulations underlying KDACi in NSCLC, taking into account the 
microenvironment of tumors related to hypoxia, and bring new insights for the 
future rational design of new therapies.

Maintenance of Na+ and K+ gradients across the cell plasma membrane is an 
essential process for mammalian cell survival. An enzyme responsible for this 
process, sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA), has been currently extensively studied 
as a potential anticancer target, especially in lung cancer and glioblastoma. To 
date, many NKA inhibitors, mainly of natural origin from the family of cardiac 
steroids (CSs), have been reported and extensively studied. Interestingly, upon 
CS binding to NKA at nontoxic doses, the role of NKA as a receptor is activated 
and intracellular signaling is triggered, upon which cancer cell death occurs, 
which lies in the expression of different NKA isoforms than in healthy cells. 
Two major CSs, digoxin and digitoxin, originally used for the treatment of 
cardiac arrhythmias, are also being tested for another indication-cancer. Such 
drug repositioning has a big advantage in smoother approval processes. Besides 
this, novel CS derivatives with improved performance are being developed and 
evaluated in combination therapy. This article deals with the NKA structure, 
mechanism of action, activity modulation, and its most important inhibitors, 
some of which could serve not only as a powerful tool to combat cancer, but also 
help to decipher the so-far poorly understood NKA regulation.

Identification of novel allosteric binding sites and multi-targeted allosteric 
inhibitors of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases using a computational 
approach.

EGFR1, VEGFR2, Bcr-Abl and Src kinases are key drug targets in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, CML, ALL, colorectal 
cancer, etc. The available drugs targeting these kinases have limited 
therapeutic efficacy due to novel mutations resulting in drug resistance and 
toxicity, as they target ATP binding site. Allosteric drugs have shown promising 
results in overcoming drug resistance, but the discovery of allosteric drugs is 
challenging. The allosteric binding pockets are difficult to predict, as they 
are generally associated with high energy conformations and regulate protein 
function in yet unknown mechanisms. In addition, the discovery of drugs using 
conventional methods takes long time and goes through several challenges, 
putting the lives of many cancer patients at risk. Therefore, the aim of the 
present work was to apply the most successful, drug repurposing approach in 
combination with computational methods to identify kinase inhibitors targeting 
novel allosteric sites on protein structure and assess their potential 
multi-kinase binding affinity. Multiple crystal structures belonging to EGFR1, 
VEGFR2, Bcr-Abl and Src tyrosine kinases were selected, including mutated, 
inhibitor bound and allosteric conformations to identify potential leads, close 
to physiological conditions. Interestingly the potential inhibitors identified 
were peptides. The drugs identified in this study could be used in therapy as a 
single multi-kinase inhibitor or in a combination of single kinase inhibitors 
after experimental validation. In addition, we have also identified new hot 
spots that are likely to be druggable allosteric sites for drug discovery of 
kinase-specific drugs in the future.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains an intractable disease, which is 
primarily due to tumor metastasis and the acquisition of resistance to 
chemotherapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics to 
overcome these obstacles. It was recently demonstrated that upregulated 
expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) contributes to the progression of 
NSCLC. G10, a tumor‑targeting representative conjugate of heptamethine 
carbocyanine dye and an inhibitor of MAOA, was shown to exert potent cytotoxic 
effects, comparable to those of doxorubicin, against prostate cancer cell lines, 
as well as moderate MAOA inhibitory activity. The research described herein 
aimed to extend our previous study on the antitumor function of G10 in NSCLC 
in vitro and in vivo, and to elucidate the mechanisms through which G10 exerts 
its antineoplastic effects. G10 markedly inhibited the proliferation of 
paclitaxel‑resistant NSCLC cells (H460/PTX) and reduced tumor cell migration and 
invasion. Gene expression profiling of paclitaxel‑resistant NSCLC cells 
following treatment with G10 demonstrated that the expression of genes 
associated with the extracellular matrix was significantly affected, 
particularly the metastasis‑related genes matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)2, MMP14 
and COL6A, which exhibited notably reduced expression. Additionally, the results 
also demonstrated that MAOA‑related pathways, including AKT and 
hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α, were also inhibited by G10 treatment and, 
subsequently, the downstream molecules of these pathways, such as p21, MMP2 and 
vascular endothelial growth factor, were also downregulated, highlighting a 
possible mechanism through which G10 suppresses tumor cell migration, invasion 
and proliferation. Importantly, in mouse NSCLC xenografts, combined treatment 
with G10 and paclitaxel resulted in pronounced inhibition of tumor growth. Taken 
together, the results of the present study highlight the potential of G10 as a 
novel therapeutic targeting MAOA in paclitaxel‑resistant NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Despite the progress of advanced target therapeutic agents and 
immune checkpoint inhibitors, EGFR-TKI resistance is still one of the biggest 
obstacles in treating lung cancer. Clinical studies with autophagy inhibitors 
are actively underway to overcome drug resistance.
METHODS: We used PC9, PC9/GR, and HCC827/GR cell lines to evaluate the 
activation of autophagy and EGFR-TKI resistance. Chloroquine was applied as an 
autophagic blocker and verteporfin was utilized as a YAP inhibitor.
RESULTS: In this study, we tried to reveal the effect of autophagy adaptor p62 
which is accumulated by autophagy inhibitor in EGFR-TKI-resistant lung 
adenocarcinoma. We identified that p62 has oncogenic functions that induce cell 
proliferation and invasion of EGFR-TKI-resistant lung adenocarcinoma. 
Interestingly, we found for the first time that YAP regulates p62 transcription 
through ERK, and YAP inhibition can suppress the expression of oncogenic p62. We 
also confirmed that the expressions of p62 and YAP have a positive correlation 
in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients. To block cell survival via 
perturbing YAP-p62 axis, we treated EGFR-TKI-resistant lung cancer cells with 
YAP inhibitor verteporfin. Remarkably, verteporfin effectively caused the death 
of EGFR-TKI-resistant lung cancer cells by decreasing the expressions of p62 
with oncogenic function, YAP, and its target PD-L1. So, the cumulative effect of 
oncogenic p62 should be considered when using autophagy inhibitors, especially 
drugs that act at the last stage of autophagy such as chloroquine and 
bafilomycin A1.
CONCLUSION: Finally, we suggest that targeting YAP-p62 signaling axis can be 
useful to suppress the EGFR-TKI-resistant lung cancer. Therefore, drug 
repurposing of verteporfin for lung cancer treatment may be valuable to consider 
because it can inhibit critical targets: p62, YAP, and PD-L1 at the same time.

Multiple driver genes in individual patient samples may cause resistance to 
individual drugs in precision medicine. However, current computational methods 
have not studied how to fill the gap between personalized driver gene 
identification and combinatorial drug discovery for individual patients. Here, 
we developed a novel structural network controllability-based personalized 
driver genes and combinatorial drug identification algorithm (CPGD), aiming to 
identify combinatorial drugs for an individual patient by targeting personalized 
driver genes from network controllability perspective. On two benchmark disease 
datasets (i.e. breast cancer and lung cancer datasets), performance of CPGD is 
superior to that of other state-of-the-art driver gene-focus methods in terms of 
discovery rate among prior-known clinical efficacious combinatorial drugs. 
Especially on breast cancer dataset, CPGD evaluated synergistic effect of 
pairwise drug combinations by measuring synergistic effect of their 
corresponding personalized driver gene modules, which are affected by a given 
targeting personalized driver gene set of drugs. The results showed that CPGD 
performs better than existing synergistic combinatorial strategies in 
identifying clinical efficacious paired combinatorial drugs. Furthermore, CPGD 
enhanced cancer subtyping by computationally providing personalized side effect 
signatures for individual patients. In addition, CPGD identified 90 drug 
combinations candidates from SARS-COV2 dataset as potential drug repurposing 
candidates for recently spreading COVID-19.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is aggressive and confers poor 
prognosis. Although SCLC shows more response to chemotherapy than other types of 
lung cancer, it is difficult to cure because of its frequent recurrence. New 
drugs and molecular targets need to be identified.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of nelfinavir, an HIV protease 
inhibitor, on SCLC cells and in preclinical treatment studies using SCLC 
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models.
RESULTS: Nelfinavir inhibited SCLC cell proliferation and induced cell death in 
vitro, which was caused by induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), 
inhibition of mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, and 
reduction in the expression of SCLC-related molecules such as achaete-scute 
homolog 1 (ASCL1). In vivo, nelfinavir inhibited the growth of SCLC PDX tumors, 
which correlated with the induction of UPR and reduced expression of ASCL1.
CONCLUSION: Nelfinavir is highly effective in SCLC in vitro and in vivo, 
suggesting possible incorporation of nelfinavir into clinical trials for 
patients with SCLC.

Lung cancer patients are at heightened risk for developing COVID-19 infection as 
well as complications due to multiple risk factors such as underlying 
malignancy, anti-cancer treatment induced immunosuppression, additional 
comorbidities and history of smoking. Recent literatures have reported a 
significant proportion of lung cancer patients coinfected with COVID-19. 
Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, 
remdesivir, favipiravir, and umifenovir represent the major repurposed drugs 
used as potential experimental agents for COVID-19 whereas azithromycin, 
dexamethasone, tocilizumab, sarilumab, famotidine and ceftriaxone are some of 
the supporting agents that are under investigation for COVID-19 management. The 
rationale of this review is to identify potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) 
occurring in lung cancer patients receiving lung cancer medications and 
repurposed COVID-19 drugs using Micromedex and additional literatures. This 
review has identified several potential DDIs that could occur with the 
concomitant treatments of COVID-19 repurposed drugs and lung cancer medications. 
This information may be utilized by the healthcare professionals for screening 
and identifying potential DDIs with adverse outcomes, based on their severity 
and documentation levels and consequently design prophylactic and management 
strategies for their prevention. Identification, reporting and management of 
DDIs and dissemination of related information should be a major consideration in 
the delivery of lung cancer care during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for 
better patient outcomes and updating guidelines for safer prescribing practices 
in this coinfected condition.

Targeted therapies and immunotherapy have brought substantial benefits to 
patients with melanoma. However, brain metastases remain the biggest threat to 
the survival and quality of life of melanoma patients. One of the major 
challenges to an effective therapy is the inability of drugs to penetrate the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB). Anti-schizophrenic drugs can cross the BBB, and many 
of them have demonstrated anti-cancer effects. Repurposing existing drugs for 
new clinical indications is an alluring strategy for anticancer drug discovery. 
Herein, we applied this strategy and screened a small collection of existing 
anti-schizophrenic drugs to use as anti-melanoma agents. Among them, 
trifluoperazine dihydrochloride (TFP) exhibited promising potencies for 
suppressing the growth and metastasis of melanoma, both in vitro and in vivo. 
TFP obviously suppressed the viability of melanoma cells within the micromolar 
range and inhibited the growth of melanoma in the subcutaneous mice models. 
Notably, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of TFP (40 mg/kg/day) obviously 
inhibited the growth of intra-carotid-injection established melanoma brain 
metastasis and extended the survival of brain metastasis-bearing mice. Moreover, 
TFP significantly suppressed lung metastasis and bone metastasis of melanoma in 
preclinical metastasis models. Mechanistically, TFP caused G0/G1 cell cycle 
arrest and mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptosis of melanoma cells. In 
addition, TFP treatment increased the expression of microtubule associated 
protein 1 light chain 3 beta-II (LC3B-II) and p62 in vitro, suggesting an 
inhibition of autophagic flux. TFP decreased LysoTracker Red uptake after 
treatment, indicating impaired acidification of lysosomes. Moreover, the 
colocalization of LC3 with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), a 
lysosome marker, was also suppressed after TFP treatment, suggesting that TFP 
might block the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, which led to 
autophagosome accumulation. Taken together, our data highlight the potential of 
repurposing TFP as a new adjuvant drug for treating melanoma patients with 
brain, lung, and bone metastases.

Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare type of cancer primarily affecting 
mesothelial cells lining the pleural cavity. In this study, we propose to 
repurpose quinacrine (QA), a widely approved anti-malarial drug, for Malignant 
Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) treatment. QA demonstrates high degree of 
cytotoxicity against both immortalized and primary patient-derived cell lines 
with sub-micromolar 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 1.2 
µM (H2452) to 5.03 µM (H28). Further, QA also inhibited cellular migration and 
colony formation in MPM cells, demonstrated using scratch and clonogenic assays, 
respectively. A 3D-spheroid cell culture experiment was performed to mimic 
in-vivo tumor conditions, and QA was reported to be highly effective in this 
simulated cellular model. Anti-angiogenic properties were also discovered for 
QA. Autophagy inhibition assay was performed, and results revealed that QA 
successfully inhibited autophagy process in MPM cells, which has been cited to 
be one of the survival pathways for MPM. Annexin V real-time apoptosis study 
revealed significant apoptotic induction in MPM cells following QA treatment. 
Western blots confirmed inhibition of autophagy and induction of apoptosis. 
These studies highlight anti-mesothelioma efficacy of QA at low doses, which can 
be instrumental in developing it as a stand-alone treatment strategy for MPM.

In recent years, personalized cancer immunotherapy, especially 
stratification-driven precision treatments have gained significant traction. 
However, due to the heterogeneity in clinical cohorts, the uncombined analysis 
of stratification/therapeutics may lead to confusion in determining ideal 
therapeutic options. We report that the coupled immune stratification and drug 
repurposing could facilitate identification of therapeutic candidates in 
patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). First, we categorized the patients 
into four groups based on immune gene profiling, associated with distinct 
molecular characteristics and clinical outcomes. Then, the weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm was used to identify 
co-expression modules of each groups. We focused on C3 group which is 
characterized by low immune infiltration (cold tumor) and wild-type EGFR, posing 
a significant challenge for treatment of LUAD. Five drug candidates against the 
C3 status were identified which have potential dual functions to correct 
aberrant immune microenvironment and also halt tumorigenesis. Furthermore, their 
steady binding affinity against the targets was verified through molecular 
docking analysis. In sum, our findings suggest that such coupled analysis could 
be a promising methodology for identification and exploration of therapeutic 
candidates in the practice of personalized immunotherapy.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an aggressive pulmonary disease which 
shares several molecular, pathophysiological and clinical aspects with lung 
cancer, including high mortality rates. The antifibrotic drugs Nintedanib and 
Pirfenidone have recently been introduced in clinical practice for the treatment 
of IPF. Nintedanib is also used for the treatment of several malignancies, 
including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with Docetaxel, 
while Pirfenidone showed some anti-neoplastic effects in preclinical studies. On 
the other hand, novel targeted agents and immunotherapies have been introduced 
in the last decade for the treatment of NSCLC, and some of them showed 
anti-fibrotic properties in recent studies. These evidences, based on the common 
pathophysiological backgrounds of IPF and lung cancer, make possible the mutual 
or combined use of anti-fibrotic and anti-neoplastic drugs to treat these highly 
lethal diseases. The aim of the present review is to depict the current 
scientific landscape regarding the repurposing of anti-neoplastic drugs in IPF 
and anti-fibrotic drugs in lung cancer, and to identify future research 
perspectives on the topic.

BACKGROUND: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process in 
tumor progression and metastasis and is also associated with drug resistance. 
Thus, controlling EMT status is a research of interest to conquer the malignant 
tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A drug repositioning analysis of transcriptomic data from 
a public cell line database identified monensin, a widely used in veterinary 
medicine, as a candidate EMT inhibitor that suppresses the conversion of the EMT 
phenotype. Using TGF-β-induced EMT cell line models, the effects of monensin on 
the EMT status and EMT-mediated drug resistance were assessed.
RESULTS: TGF-β treatment induced EMT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines and the EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines with TGF-β-induced EMT acquired 
resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The addition of monensin 
effectively suppressed the TGF-β-induced-EMT conversion, and restored the growth 
inhibition and the induction of apoptosis by the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that combined therapy with monensin might be a 
useful strategy for preventing EMT-mediated acquired drug resistance.

Repurposing denosumab in lung cancer beyond counteracting the skeletal related 
events: an intriguing perspective.

Kapodistrian University of Athens, Faculty of Medicine , Athens, Greece.

INTRODUCTION: Repurposing denosumab in lung cancer therapeutics capitalizes on 
its well-established role in preventing the skeletal related events (SREs) and 
its emerging, yet elusive, bone-independent role, assigned to inhibit the 
contribution of RANKL to cancer initiation and progression.
AREAS COVERED: The present review presents the available preclinical and 
clinical data indicating that denosumab may provide survival benefit to lung 
cancer patients beyond the counteraction of SREs.
EXPERT OPINION: Despite the preliminary data heralding the potential of 
denosumab to increase overall survival in lung cancer, the embracement of this 
strategy in clinical practice cannot be advocated until large randomized 
clinical trials consolidate its safety and efficacy. Given the improvement of 
lung cancer prognosis ascribed to revolutionary targeted treatment agents, the 
possibility of denosumab-related increased risk of second primary malignancies 
merits further evaluation. Many challenges in endorsing denosumab as a strategy 
to treat lung cancer beyond SREs prevention are pending counteraction, 
including: (i) patient selection guided by validated predictive and prognostic 
biomarkers; (ii) assessment of long-term outcomes; (iii) evaluation of 
benefit-risk ratio; (iv) translational research; (v) combination of denosumab 
with other targeted therapies; (vi) integration of genomic biomarkers, 
immune-related biomarkers, and biomarkers of active RANKL pathway to guide the 
decision-making process.

New drug and dosage form development faces significant challenges, especially in 
oncology, due to longer development cycle and associated scale-up complexities. 
Repurposing of existing drugs with potential anti-cancer activity into new 
therapeutic regimens provides a feasible alternative. In this project, 
amodiaquine (AQ), an anti-malarial drug, has been explored for its anti-cancer 
efficacy through formulating inhalable nanoparticulate systems using 
high-pressure homogenization (HPH) with scale-up feasibility and high 
reproducibility. A 32 multifactorial design was employed to better understand 
critical processes (probe homogenization speed while formulating coarse 
emulsion) and formulation parameters (concentration of cationic polymer in 
external aqueous phase) so as to ensure product quality with improved anticancer 
efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Optimized AQ loaded 
nanoparticles (AQ NP) were evaluated for physicochemical properties, stability 
profile, in-vitro aerosol deposition behavior, cytotoxic potential against NSCLC 
cells in-vitro and in 3D simulated tumor spheroid model. The highest probe 
homogenization speed (25,000 rpm) resulted in lower particle size. Incorporation 
of cationic polymer, polyethylenimine (0.5% w/v) resulted in high drug loading 
efficiencies at optimal drug quantity of 5 mg. Formulated nanoparticles (liquid 
state) exhibited an aerodynamic diameter of 4.7 ± 0.1 μm and fine particle 
fraction of 81.0 ± 9.1%, indicating drug deposition in the respirable airways. 
Cytotoxicity studies in different NSCLC cell lines revealed significant 
reduction in IC50 values with AQ-loaded nanoparticles compared to plain drug, 
along with significant cell migration inhibition (scratch assay) and reduced % 
colony growth (clonogenic assay) in A549 cells with AQ NP. Moreover, 3D 
simulated spheroid studies revealed efficacy of nanoparticles in penetration to 
tumor core, and growth inhibition. AQ's autophagy inhibition ability 
significantly increased (increased LC3B-II levels) with nanoparticle 
encapsulation, along with moderate improvement in apoptosis induction (Caspase-3 
levels). No impact was observed on HUVEC angiogenesis suggesting alternative 
anticancer mechanisms. To conclude, amodiaquine can be a promising candidate for 
repurposing to treat NSCLC while delivering inhalable nanoparticles developed 
using a scalable HPH process. Despite the involvement of complex parameters, 
application of DoE has simplified the process of product and process 
optimization.

While aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) is 
a tumor suppressor, its exon 2-depleted splice variant (AIMP2-DX2 or shortly 
DX2) is highly expressed in human lung cancer, and the ratio of DX2 to AIMP2 
increases according to the progression of lung cancer. In this study, 
pyrimethamine inhibited the level of DX2 (IC50 = 0.73 µM) in A549 cells 
expressing nanoluciferase-tagged DX2. In a panel of 5 lung cancer cell lines 
with various DX2 levels, pyrimethamine most potently suppressed the growth of 
H460 cells, which express high levels of DX2 (GI50 = 0.01 µM). An immunoblot 
assay in H460 cells showed that pyrimethamine decreased the DX2 level 
dose-dependently but did not affect the AIMP2 level. Further experiments 
confirmed that pyrimethamine resulted in ubiquitination-mediated DX2 
degradation. In an in vivo mouse xenograft assay using H460 cells, 
intraperitoneal administration of pyrimethamine significantly reduced the tumor 
size and weight, comparable with the effects of taxol, without affecting body 
weight. Analysis of tumor tissue showed a considerably high concentration of 
pyrimethamine with a decreased levels of DX2. These results suggest that 
pyrimethamine, currently used as anti-parasite drug, could be repurposed to 
treat lung cancer patients expressing high level of DX2.

Drug repurposing is an attractive and pragmatic way offering reduced risks and 
development time in the complicated process of drug discovery. In the past, drug 
repurposing has been largely accidental and serendipitous. The most successful 
examples so far have not involved a systematic approach. Nowadays, remarkable 
advances in drugs, diseases and bioinformatic knowledge are offering great 
opportunities for designing novel drug repurposing approach through 
comprehensive understanding of drug information. In this study, we introduced a 
novel drug repurposing approach based on transcriptomic data and chemical 
structures using deep learning. One strong candidate for repurposing has been 
identified. Pimozide is an anti-dyskinesia agent that is used for the 
suppression of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette's Disorder. 
However, our pipeline proposed it as a strong candidate for treating non-small 
cell lung cancer. The cytotoxicity of pimozide against A549 cell lines has been 
validated.

PURPOSE: Nelfinavir (NFV), a FDA approved antiretroviral drug, has been reported 
to exhibit cancer cells growth inhibition and increased apoptosis. However, it 
requires a higher dose leading to toxicity, thus limiting its potential clinical 
translation. We aim to develop biodegradable (poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)) 
PLGA nanoparticles of nelfinavir and determine their efficacy to treat non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HIV protease inhibitor, NFV, was loaded into PLGA 
nanoparticles by double emulsion/solvent evaporation method; and nanoparticles 
were characterized for physicochemical characteristics including morphology and 
intracellular uptake. Their anti-cancer efficacy in NSCLC was assessed by in 
vitro assays including cytotoxicity, cellular migration, colony formation; and 
3D spheroid culture mimicking in-vivo tumor microenvironment. Studies were also 
conducted to elucidate effects on molecular pathways including apoptosis, 
autophagy, and endoplasmic stress.
RESULTS: NFV loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) were found to have particle size: 
191.1 ± 10.0 nm, zeta potential: -24.3 ± 0.9 mV, % drug loading: 2.5 ± 0.0%; and 
entrapment efficiency (EE): 30.1 ± 0.5%. NFV NP inhibited proliferation of NSCLC 
cells compared to NFV and exhibited significant IC50 reduction. From the 
caspase-dependent apoptosis assays and western blot studies (upregulation of 
ATF3), it was revealed that NFV NP significantly induced ER stress marker ATF3, 
cleaved PARP and further caused autophagy inhibition (LC3BII upregulation) 
leading to increased cellular death. In addition, NFV NP were found to be more 
efficacious in penetrating solid tumors in ex-vivo studies compared to plain 
NFV.
CONCLUSIONS: Nelfinavir, a lead HIV protease inhibitor can be repositioned as a 
NSCLC therapeutic through nanoparticulate delivery. Given its ability to induce 
apoptosis and efficient tumor penetration capability, NFV loaded PLGA 
nanoparticulate systems provide a promising delivery system in NSCLC treatment.

Despite the continual discovery of promising new cancer targets, drug discovery 
is often hampered by the poor druggability of these targets. As such, 
repurposing FDA-approved drugs based on cancer signatures is a useful 
alternative to cancer precision medicine. Here, we adopted an in silico approach 
based on large-scale gene expression signatures to identify drug candidates for 
lung cancer metastasis. Our clinicogenomic analysis identified GALNT14 as a 
putative driver of lung cancer metastasis, leading to poor survival. To overcome 
the poor druggability of GALNT14 in the control of metastasis, we utilized the 
Connectivity Map and identified bortezomib (BTZ) as a potent metastatic 
inhibitor, bypassing the direct inhibition of the enzymatic activity of GALNT14. 
The antimetastatic effect of BTZ was verified both in vitro and in vivo. 
Notably, both BTZ treatment and GALNT14 knockdown attenuated TGFβ-mediated gene 
expression and suppressed TGFβ-dependent metastatic genes. These results 
demonstrate that our in silico approach is a viable strategy for the use of 
undruggable targets in cancer therapies and for revealing the underlying 
mechanisms of these targets.

Drug-disease association is an important piece of information which participates 
in all stages of drug repositioning. Although the number of drug-disease 
associations identified by high-throughput technologies is increasing, the 
experimental methods are time consuming and expensive. As supplement to them, 
many computational methods have been developed for an accurate in silico 
prediction for new drug-disease associations. In this work, we present a novel 
computational model combining sparse auto-encoder and rotation forest (SAEROF) 
to predict drug-disease association. Gaussian interaction profile kernel 
similarity, drug structure similarity and disease semantic similarity were 
extracted for exploring the association among drugs and diseases. On this basis, 
a rotation forest classifier based on sparse auto-encoder is proposed to predict 
the association between drugs and diseases. In order to evaluate the performance 
of the proposed model, we used it to implement 10-fold cross validation on two 
golden standard datasets, Fdataset and Cdataset. As a result, the proposed model 
achieved AUCs (Area Under the ROC Curve) of Fdataset and Cdataset are 0.9092 and 
0.9323, respectively. For performance evaluation, we compared SAEROF with the 
state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier and some existing 
computational models. Three human diseases (Obesity, Stomach Neoplasms and Lung 
Neoplasms) were explored in case studies. As a result, more than half of the top 
20 drugs predicted were successfully confirmed by the Comparative Toxicogenomics 
Database(CTD database). This model is a feasible and effective method to predict 
drug-disease correlation, and its performance is significantly improved compared 
with existing methods.

Drug repurposing is on the rise as an atypical strategy for discovery of new 
molecules, involving use of pre-existing molecules for a different therapeutic 
application than the approved indication. Using this strategy, the current study 
aims to leverage effects of quinacrine (QA), a well-known anti-malarial drug, 
for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For respiratory diseases, 
designing a QA loaded inhalable delivery system has multiple advantages over 
invasive delivery. QA-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) were thus prepared using 
polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a cationic stabilizer. While the use of PEI provided 
cationic charge on the particles, it also mediated a burst release of QA and 
demonstrated potential particle toxicity. These concerns were circumvented by 
coating nanoparticles with bovine serum albumin (BSA), which retained the 
cationic charge, reduced NP toxicity and modulated QA release. Prepared 
nanoparticles were characterized for physicochemical properties along with their 
aerosolization potential. Therapeutic efficacy of the formulations was tested in 
different NSCLC cells. Mechanism of higher anti-proliferation was evaluated by 
studying cell cycle profile, apoptosis and molecular markers involved in the 
progression of lung cancer. BSA coated QA nanoparticles demonstrated good 
aerosolization potential with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 
significantly less than 5 µm. Nanoparticles also demonstrated improved 
therapeutic efficacy against NSCLC cells in terms of low IC50 values, cell cycle 
arrest at G2/M phase and autophagy inhibition leading to increased apoptosis. 
BSA coated QA NPs also demonstrated enhanced therapeutic efficacy in a 3D cell 
culture model. The present study thus lays solid groundwork for pre-clinical and 
eventual clinical studies as a standalone therapy and in combination with 
existing chemotherapeutics.

A pre-eminent subtype of lung carcinoma, Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 
paramount causes of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Undeterred by the 
endeavour in the treatment strategies, the overall cure and survival rates for 
NSCLC remain substandard, particularly in metastatic diseases. Moreover, the 
emergence of resistance to classic anticancer drugs further deteriorates the 
situation. These demanding circumstances culminate the need of extended and 
revamped research for the establishment of upcoming generation cancer 
therapeutics. Drug repositioning introduces an affordable and efficient strategy 
to discover novel drug action, especially when integrated with recent systems 
biology driven stratagem. This review illustrates the trendsetting approaches in 
repurposing along with their numerous success stories with an emphasize on the 
NSCLC therapeutics. Indeed, these novel hits, in combination with conventional 
anticancer agents, will ideally make their way the clinics and strengthen the 
therapeutic arsenal to combat drug resistance in the near future.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and categorize the survival benefit of tricyclic 
antidepressants (TCAs) in lung cancer patients based on systematic computational 
drug repositioning data.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively extracted from the medical records of 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from the University of Cincinnati 
Cancer Medical Center database. Patients receiving antidepressants during their 
course of anti-cancer treatment were compared with those without 
antidepressants. Data were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier survival curves with the 
log-rank test, and overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of 
diagnosis until last follow-up or death.
RESULTS: The median OS at 2 and 5 years for patients on antidepressants was 20.3 
months (54.7% and 42%) vs 44.3 months (47.6% and 43.2%), which was not 
significant. The median OS for patients receiving TCAs, selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, and other antidepressants was 3.17 months, 31.33 months, 
and 18.50 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We found no significant survival benefit for TCA use in combination 
with anti-cancer agents in NSCLC patients.

The recent interest in beta-blockers as possible agents for drug repurposing in 
oncology arises from many pre-clinical and epidemiologic studies suggesting a 
possible clinically relevant antitumour effect. In lung cancer, given the 
contradictory results obtained, it is crucial to further study its effects. A 
systematic review of the literature was planned to evaluate a possible 
beneficial effect of beta-blocker on overall survival in lung cancer patients. 
Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception until 1 May 2018 to 
identify published studies that assessed the effect beta-blocker use on overall 
survival in lung cancer patients. Risk of bias was evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa 
scale. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for overall survival were 
estimated using a random-effects model. Of 920 studies, seven (all retrospective 
and observational, six cohort and one case-control), including 7448 patients, 
met the inclusion criteria. Beta-blocker users with lung cancer had no increased 
overall survival compared to non-users (hazard ratio = 1.00; 95% confidence 
interval = 0.91-1.10; I = 45%). Similarly, beta-blocker users with non-small 
cell lung cancer had no increased overall survival compared to beta-blocker 
non-users (hazard ratio = 0.96; 95% confidence interval = 0.80-1.17; I = 56%). 
Our findings do not suggest an overall survival advantage in patients with lung 
cancer using beta-blocker therapy when compared to non-users. Further 
prospective cohort studies, designed to overcome the intrinsic limitations of 
retrospective observational studies are warranted to definitively clarify any 
possible beneficial effect of beta-blockers on lung cancer overall survival.

BACKGROUND: PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has received approval for clinical application 
due to its encouraging benefit with improving prognosis in selected populations. 
Unfortunately, the response to immunotherapy for many patients remains 
unsatisfactory. It remains a great challenge to generate potential combinations 
that will outperform single agents alone with regard to anti-tumor activity.
METHODS: Using NSCLC cell lines and mouse models, we explored the effects of 
combined niclosamide and PD-L1 blockade on tumor growth and T cell function. 
Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between PD-L1 and p-STAT3 
expression in tumor samples from patients with NSCLC using IHC, as well as their 
relationship to patient survival.
RESULTS: In vitro, niclosamide, an antihelmintic drug, enhanced the cancer cell 
lysis mediated by T cells in the presence of PD-L1 blockade. Accordingly, mice 
treated with niclosamide and PD-L1 antibody showed significant delay in tumor 
growth and increased survival which were associated with the increase of tumor 
infiltrating T cells and granzyme B release. Importantly, we found niclosamide 
could decrease the expression of PD-L1 in both a concentration- and 
time-dependent manner in NSCLC cells, which was linked to the blockage of 
p-STAT3 binding to the promoter of PD-L1.
CONCLUSIONS: An enhancement of PD-L1 antibody by niclosamide was observed in 
inhibition of NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo, which was involved in blockage 
of p-STAT3 binding to promoter of PD-L1 and finally downregulation of PD-L1 
expression. These encourage the combination therapy of niclosamide and 
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to be further studied in clinic.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma is the major cause of cancer-related deaths in 
the world. Given this, the importance of research on its pathophysiology and 
therapy remains a key health issue. To assist in this endeavor, recent oncology 
studies are adopting Systems Biology approaches and bioinformatics to analyze 
and understand omics data, bringing new insights about this disease and its 
treatment.
METHODS: We used reverse engineering of transcriptomic data to reconstruct 
nontumorous lung reference networks, focusing on transcription factors (TFs) and 
their inferred target genes, referred as regulatory units or regulons. 
Afterwards, we used 13 case-control studies to identify TFs acting as master 
regulators of the disease and their regulatory units. Furthermore, the inferred 
activation patterns of regulons were used to evaluate patient survival and 
search drug candidates for repositioning.
RESULTS: The regulatory units under the influence of ATOH8, DACH1, EPAS1, ETV5, 
FOXA2, FOXM1, HOXA4, SMAD6, and UHRF1 transcription factors were consistently 
associated with the pathological phenotype, suggesting that they may be master 
regulators of lung adenocarcinoma. We also observed that the inferred activity 
of FOXA2, FOXM1, and UHRF1 was significantly associated with risk of death in 
patients. Finally, we obtained deptropine, promazine, valproic acid, 
azacyclonol, methotrexate, and ChemBridge ID compound 5109870 as potential 
candidates to revert the molecular profile leading to decreased survival.
CONCLUSION: Using an integrated transcriptomics approach, we identified master 
regulator candidates involved with the development and prognostic of lung 
adenocarcinoma, as well as potential drugs for repurposing.

The incidence of melanoma is increasing rapidly worldwide. Additionally, new and 
effective candidates for treating melanoma are needed because of the increase in 
drug resistance and the high metastatic potential of this cancer. The STAT3 
signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of melanoma, making STAT3 
a promising anticancer target for melanoma therapy. Niclosamide, an FDA-approved 
anti-helminthic drug, has been identified as a potent STAT3 inhibitor that 
suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 and its transcript activity. In this 
study, we evaluated the biological activities of niclosamide in melanoma in 
vitro and in vivo. Niclosamide potently inhibited the growth of four melanoma 
cell lines and induced the apoptosis of melanoma cells via the mitochondrial 
apoptotic pathway. Further, western blot analysis indicated that cell apoptosis 
was correlated with activation of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and decreased 
expression of Bcl-2. Moreover, niclosamide markedly impaired melanoma cell 
migration and invasion, reduced phosphorylated STAT3Tyr705 levels, and inhibited 
matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 expression. Additionally, in a xenograft model 
of A375, intraperitoneal administration of niclosamide inhibited tumor growth 
and tumor weight in a dose-dependent manner without obvious side effects. 
Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed a decrease in 
Ki-67-positive cells and p-STAT3Try705-positive cells and increase in cleaved 
caspase-3-positive cells. Notably, niclosamide significantly inhibited pulmonary 
metastasis in a B16-F10 melanoma lung metastasis model, including the number of 
lung metastatic nodules and lung/body coefficient. Importantly, a marked 
reduction in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Gr1+CD11b+) infiltration in the 
pulmonary metastasis tissue was observed. Taken together, these results 
demonstrate that niclosamide is a promising candidate for treating melanoma.

Recent advances in DNA/RNA sequencing have made it possible to identify new 
targets rapidly and to repurpose approved drugs for treating heterogeneous 
diseases by the 'precise' targeting of individualized disease modules. In this 
study, we develop a Genome-wide Positioning Systems network (GPSnet) algorithm 
for drug repurposing by specifically targeting disease modules derived from 
individual patient's DNA and RNA sequencing profiles mapped to the human 
protein-protein interactome network. We investigate whole-exome sequencing and 
transcriptome profiles from ~5,000 patients across 15 cancer types from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that GPSnet-predicted disease modules can predict 
drug responses and prioritize new indications for 140 approved drugs. 
Importantly, we experimentally validate that an approved cardiac arrhythmia and 
heart failure drug, ouabain, shows potential antitumor activities in lung 
adenocarcinoma by uniquely targeting a HIF1α/LEO1-mediated cell metabolism 
pathway. In summary, GPSnet offers a network-based, in silico drug repurposing 
framework for more efficacious therapeutic selections.

Anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs mainly trigger apoptosis induction to 
eliminate malignant cells. However, many cancer cells are chemoresistant because 
of defective apoptosis induction. Targeting the autophagic pathway is currently 
regarded as an alternative strategy for cancer drug discovery. Penfluridol, an 
antipsychotic drug, has been reported to exert oncostatic effects, but the 
effect of penfluridol on lung cancer remains unknown. Herein, the antitumor 
activity of penfluridol was determined in vitro in non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) cell lines using MTS, plate clonogenic, and transwell migration assays 
and in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft model. Flow cytometry, holotomographic 
microscopy, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were employed to 
determine the cell-death phenotype induced by penfluridol in vitro and in vivo. 
Western blotting and genetic knockdown by small interfering RNA were performed 
to explore the underlying mechanisms involved in penfluridol-mediated cell 
death. We uncovered that penfluridol inhibited the viability and motility of 
NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Penfluridol induced nonapoptotic cell death by 
blocking autophagic flux and inducing accumulation of autophagosome-related 
protein, light chain 3 (LC3) B-II, in HCC827 and A549 NSCLC cells, and in an 
A549 orthotopic xenograft tumor model. Autophagosome accumulation-induced cell 
viability inhibition by penfluridol was mainly attributed to ATP energy 
deprivation. Moreover, we observed that patients with lung tumors expressing 
high LC3B had longer overall and disease-free survival times. Mechanistically, 
upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein 
response (UPR) pathways and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) were critical for penfluridol-induced autophagosome accumulation. Our 
findings identify that penfluridol acts as an inducer of ER stress and p38 MAPK 
activation, which led to UPR-mediated nonapoptotic cell death via autophagosome 
accumulation-caused energy loss. Penfluridol is clinically used for 
schizophrenia, and our study results strongly support penfluridol as a 
repurposed drug for treating NSCLC.

Introduction: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare neoplasm with a 
poor prognosis, as current therapies are ineffective. Despite the increased 
understanding of the molecular biology of mesothelioma, there is still a lack of 
drugs that dramatically enhance patient survival. Area Covered: This review 
discusses recent and complete clinical trials supported by the NIH, other U.S. 
Federal agencies, universities and organizations found on clinicaltrials.gov. 
Firstly, chemotherapy-based trials are described, followed by immunotherapy and 
multitargeted therapy. Then we introduce drug repositioning and the use of drug 
docking as tools to find new interesting molecules. Finally, we highlight 
potential molecular pathways that may play a role in mesothelioma biology and 
therapy. Expert Opinion: Numerous biases are present in the clinical trials due 
to a restricted number of cases, inappropriate endpoints and inaccurate 
stratification of patients which delay the finding of a treatment for MPM. The 
most crucial issue of independent research for MPM is the lack of more 
substantive funding to translate these findings to the clinical setting. 
However, this approach is not necessarily scientific given the low mutational 
load of mesothelioma relative to other cancers, and therefore patients need a 
more solid rationale to have a good chance of successful treatment.

BACKGROUND: Despite a wealth of preclinical and observational data, prospective 
data regarding the use of metformin in lung cancer is extremely limited.
METHODS: We pooled individualized data from two prospective trials evaluating 
metformin plus platinum-based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, in 
non-diabetic patients with untreated advanced NSCLC. In addition to reporting on 
clinical efficacy and safety endpoints, we also explored metformin's activity in 
key molecular cohorts.
RESULTS: 33 patients were included in the pooled analysis, of whom 70% were 
current or previous smokers. 82% had standard tissue molecular testing results 
available. KRAS, EGFR, and LKB1 mutation prevalence was 48%, 26%, and 8.3%, 
respectively. Composite median PFS was 6 months for all patients (95% CI: [1.36, 
7.96]), 7.2 months for KRAS mutants (95% CI: [1.18, 9.21]), and 6.6 months for 
EGFR mutants (95% CI: [1.18, 15.29]). Composite median OS was 14.8 months for 
all patients (95% CI: [8.25, 19.99]), 17.5 months for KRAS mutants (95% CI: 
[8.86, 26.96]), and 13.3 months for EGFR mutants (95% CI: [2.60, 25.86]). 
Lymphopenia was the most common grade 3 AE (12%), followed by leukopenia, 
nausea, vomiting, and hypertension (9% each). There were 2 grade 4 AEs, 
neutropenia (21%) and sepsis (3%), and 1 grade 5 AE (colonic perforation) 
attributed to bevacizumab.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the previously shown efficacy and tolerability 
of metformin in combination with chemotherapy and highlight encouraging activity 
in key molecular cohorts. Future efforts should build on this work by 
prospectively studying metformin in these molecular subgroups.
